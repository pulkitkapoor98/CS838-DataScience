 And student protests at universities like <uname>University of Wisconsin</uname> have been held in particularly high regard, because <uname>Wisconsin</uname> students are traditionally seen as respectable, white, middle- to upper-class people who are attending university in order to learn skills that send them off into the kinds of careers that make them pillars of their communities. This doesn’t mean protests at places like <uname>University of Wisconsin</uname> are more important. But rather, the factors that have historically allowed students on <uname>Wisconsin</uname> college campuses to protest without undue pushback from college administrators have made colleges generally more protected environments in which to engage in free speech. So any threat to the rights to protest and speak openly in the university environment means the future of free speech elsewhere in our country looks dim.The only campus protest cited in the discussion of the new anti-protest rule issue is when students shouted down and “traded obscene gestures” with the ex-Breitbart editor Ben Shapiro last year. So school administrators must be quaking in their boots at the idea that students might stand up and disrupt a speaker, an activity students there have engaged in since at least 1918, when students disrupted a talk by the historian Robert McNutt McElroy. But now verbal interruptions are clearly so dangerous to the functioning of Wisconsin’s public universities that they must be stopped.The <uname>University of Wisconsin</uname> System, by punishing student protests, is turning its back on more than a century of its own storied history and stated values in order to protect conservative opinions that are apparently too fragile to withstand a round of student yelling. But surely a little heckling isn’t sufficient cause to take away free speech rights.
