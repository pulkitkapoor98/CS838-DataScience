 The university’s search had originally seemed to focus on hiring an outsider — especially one with fund-raising prowess. But over the course of his stewardship, Dr. Boudreau won many people over, including donors, for restoring order and creating the impression that he was transparent, accountable and approachable.When asked about Dr. Boudreau, James B. Milliken, <uname>CUNY</uname>’s chancellor, said, “I’m not in a position at this time to comment on the search process.” But he said that as interim president Dr. Boudreau “has demonstrated leadership under some tough circumstances, stabilized <uname>City College</uname>, been working closely with us in addressing the budget deficit, and he’s led with integrity and transparency.”With 16,000 students, most of them undergraduates, <uname>City College</uname> has been called “the poor man’s <uname>Harvard</uname>” for educating thousands of poor, minority and immigrant students. This week, the college ranked second on a list of four-year public colleges with the most success helping low-income students move to the middle class, according to The Chronicle of Higher Education.
