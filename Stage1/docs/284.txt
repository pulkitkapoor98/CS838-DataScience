 Maybe it sounds unreasonable to expect a college administration to keep up with the speed of internet discourse. But when several campus groups organized walkouts, demonstrations, rallies and marches to signal solidarity with black students, it took the <uname>Penn</uname> administration several days to publicly join and support the actions.Black and brown students need more than official statements of concern to feel safe and welcome in college. The GroupMe incident provides a pretty good example of how amorphous online threats can still be powerfully targeted at us in terrifyingly specific ways.The racist chat appeared to have been created in Oklahoma, but for the creator to have known so many members of the black freshman class, he or she would have to have been at <uname>Penn</uname>. So black students immediately assumed it was coming from somewhere on campus. There were multiple individuals who were taunting students on this chat, and all were anonymized by pseudonyms. So the big questions were: How many people were involved? Would they act on their covert threats? How much of the population of the school did they speak for? The chats also included a racial taunt that invoked the fraternity Sigma Alpha Epsilon, some chapters of which have been shut down at other campuses for racist behavior. (The <uname>Penn</uname> S.A.E. chapter immediately denounced the online attacks.)Working with the F.B.I., the administration was able to identify the creator of the GroupMe chat within a few weeks — a student at the <uname>University of Oklahoma</uname> who had been accepted to <uname>Penn</uname> but chose not to attend. The student was suspended, and both the <uname>University of Pennsylvania</uname> and the <uname>University of Oklahoma</uname> issued condemnations of his actions. Ultimately, the investigation found that no <uname>Penn</uname> students were involved in the chat. But these kinds of incidents make black and brown students increasingly wary.GroupMe is an important method of communication among hall mates, study group partners, band members, fraternity brothers and sometimes entire classes. It’s not as if we can just stop using the app to avoid racism.An anonymous attack on GroupMe doesn’t feel that different from racist propaganda in “real life.” Just a few months ago, someone put up neo-Nazi recruitment fliers around campus. They were promptly removed, but the incident had an important thing in common with the GroupMe disaster: anonymity.
