 The most disadvantaged students don’t usually write essays about those experiences, Mr. Fitzsimmons said. They may think their backgrounds would be held against them or they may not even have heard of the first-gen label. Some assume they don’t qualify because they have siblings who have gone to college.Anthony A. Jack, a <uname>Harvard</uname> education professor who researches the experiences of lower-income students, said a student once asked if he could join a support group even though his father had a master’s degree. The boy had been raised by extended family who had not gone to college, and the father, who had an arrest record, had not been part of his son’s life. “That’s not a parental influence,” Dr. Jack said.Some support groups and scholarship organizations define the term broadly to be more inclusive. To underscore economic issues, the <uname>University of Pennsylvania</uname> has created an F.G.L.I. program for “first-generation and/or low-income students.” <uname>Brown</uname> opened its First-Generation College and Low-Income Student Center last year.Some public policy experts believe the definition should be narrowed for admissions and financial aid. Tomiko Nagin, a <uname>Harvard</uname> law professor, argues that only those most in need should receive special admissions considerations. She wants both parental education and income taken into account, limiting the definition to those whose parents never attended college and are eligible for Pell grants. That means an income below 0,000. “Universities must attack disadvantage at its roots,” she wrote in a <uname>University of Chicago</uname> law review article.The Institute for Higher Education Policy last year released a report, financed by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, similarly calling for the definition to be narrowed so that students whose parents had an associate degree could no longer be counted as first gen.The institute’s analysis of education statistics helps explain its reasoning. If students who attended a four-year college had parents with no education after high school, only 50 percent graduated within six years. If at least one parent had some college but no degree, the graduation rate was 57 percent. But if at least one parent had an associate degree or higher, the rate jumped to 72 percent.
 Myth 1: For the big money, STEM always delivers.It’s true that computer science and engineering top all the pay rankings, but salaries within specific majors vary greatly.“Students and parents have a pretty good idea of what majors pay the most, but they have a poor sense of the magnitude of the differences within the major,” said Douglas A. Webber, an associate professor of economics at <uname>Temple University</uname> who studies earnings by academic field. He points to one example: The top quarter of earners who majored in English make more over their lifetimes than the bottom quarter of chemical engineers.
