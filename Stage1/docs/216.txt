 “I think it’s more of a New York thing — a cynical, don’t-accept-the-easy-but-enjoy-the-underdog thing. A sort of toughness and refusal to be taken in. It’s more of a city experience, and <uname>Columbia</uname> has always been part of that, and football has been an emblem of that.”For the moment, alumni dollars aren’t reflecting any such jaundice. On Oct. 18, the annual <uname>Columbia</uname> Giving Day yielded over .1 million in pledges for athletics, compared with .7 million in 2016, according to Lauren Dwyer, the university’s senior associate director of athletics development. Last year, about 60,000 was earmarked for football; this year the total so far is 02,000, Ms. Dwyer said.In general, current students are more enthusiastic than battle-hardened alumni. “I don’t know about you, but I’ve found my heroes,” wrote Joseph Siegel, a sophomore, recently in the <uname>Columbia</uname> Daily Spectator. “The titanic athletes in their helmets and pads, the wide expanse of the stadium, the goal posts and lights scraping into the sky; for all this, I see no substitute.”Some alumni are simply coming to grips with their own changing perceptions.“The pure joy of <uname>Columbia</uname> football is that we’re not supposed to be good,” said captain, <uname>Columbia College</uname> class of 1999. A New York-based lawyer, he vividly remembers the coverage on the student-run radio station WKCR-FM.
