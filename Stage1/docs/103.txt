 There’s a reason Congress is listening to Mr. Cartney. President Barack Obama went there in 2015 to give the commencement address, and the <uname>Aspen Institute</uname>, a Washington-based educational and policy studies organization, gave the two-year college the 2017 Prize for Community College Excellence.In the announcement of the award in March, the organization cited the college’s “outstanding” graduation rate, which is twice the national average compared with other community colleges, and its 99 percent job placement rate. The school’s student-loan default rate is also about half the national average.A couple of key reasons: The college holds its 2,400 students accountable, as if they were in a job setting. And the college has close ties with local and regional industry (every major, for example, has an advisory board of industry professionals). Hence, they are able to develop programs that mirror the needs of employers.Mr. Cartney also takes a pragmatic view of education. “We view college as a pathway,” he said, “not a destination.”Miami Dade CollegeThe college’s new degree in data analytics is one of the first in Florida. But what’s particularly innovative is the way the training is offered. The program begins with a certificate in business intelligence, progresses to an associate in science in business intelligence and culminates in a bachelor of science in data analytics.The Labor Department defines this “stackable” approach as a sequence of credentials that can be accumulated to build up students’ qualifications and help them move along a career path.“This provides flexibility for those students who might need to be in the work force while in school,” said Karen Elzey, vice president of the Business-Higher Education Forum, which was a partner in starting the program.
