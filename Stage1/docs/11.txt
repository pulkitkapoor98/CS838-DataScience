 “Let’s assume that tomorrow the price of Bitcoin drops down to ,” said Nicolas Christin, a computer science professor at <uname>Carnegie Mellon</uname>, who is teaching a course on “Cryptocurrencies, Blockchains and Applications” this semester. “I still think it’s very cool from a technical standpoint.”Professors and students alike said that aside from the academic possibilities, familiarity with blockchain technology was becoming much more useful on the job market.
 The job site Indeed.com has reported a spike in job listings that mention the blockchain, and there is now an entire site, Crypto Jobs List, dedicated to opportunities in the young industry.Vinny Tuminelli, a business school student sitting at the back of the <uname>Berkeley</uname> class, said that during an internship at Anheuser-Busch last summer, the blockchain had come up in an “innovation team” he was on. When he met with his supervisor more recently, the topic came up again.“My original understanding was that it was just thrown out there as a buzzword,” Mr. Tuminelli said. “But now it seems like it has some legs behind it, and people are putting real resources toward it.”Students appear to have caught on to the opportunity faster than their professors. <uname>Berkeley</uname> students have created a campus club that offers multiple courses on blockchain technology, taught by the students themselves.
