 At the <uname>University of South Carolina</uname>, the private-sector construction of thousands of apartments just off campus, with nearly as many parking spaces, has created an opportunity to rethink the need for aging garages on prime land in the center of campus, said Derrick Huggins, the vice president of facilities and transportation. A parking study underway will help officials determine how much parking space they really need, as more students are now able to walk, bike or take public transit to campus, he said.“This is something I’ve been working on for five years — the phenomenon of how this close proximity of private housing is impacting our campus,” Mr. Huggins said.<uname>Santa Clara University</uname>, a Jesuit school in California with about 8,000 students, closed down some roads and parking lots in the center of its campus to create pedestrian malls. The university built a new parking structure farther out to replace those spaces, but it is working on reducing the number of cars on campus with incentives to use bikes, car shares and rail, said Tim O’Keefe, the manager of business technology in university operations.“I think it’s a little premature to think about a reduction in parking spaces,” he said. “We haven’t yet seen a huge paradigm shift in the number of people coming to campus in alternative modes of transportation.”However, last year, the university became among the first to begin testing a self-driving campus shuttle. Run by a start-up called Auro Robotics, the electric shuttle carried three passengers at a time, along with a safety engineer, in case of glitches.
 The first new college class since the election of Donald J. Trump has arrived on campus, and new numbers confirm what the higher education industry had feared: Fewer foreign students are coming to the United States.The number of newly arriving international students declined an average 7 percent in fall 2017, with 45 percent of campuses reporting drops in new international enrollment, according to a survey of nearly 500 campuses across the country by the <uname>Institute of International Education</uname>.Experts cited an uncertain social and political climate in the United States as part of the reason for the decline in enrollment.“It’s a mix of factors,” said Rajika Bhandari, head of research for the institute, which collects data on international students in cooperation with the State Department. “Concerns around the travel ban had a lot to do with concerns around personal safety based on a few incidents involving international students, and a generalized concern about whether they’re safe.”
