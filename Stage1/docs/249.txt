 “The <uname>University of Florida</uname> can’t say we like country music, but we don’t like alternative music — or in this case, we like diversity, but we don’t like Richard Spencer’s message,” Clay Calvert, a journalism professor and First Amendment expert at the university, said.The university is obligated to protect Mr. Spencer from demonstrators exercising what is called “the heckler’s veto,” Mr. Calvert said. “That’s the idea that the First Amendment does not allow an audience of hostile reaction to silence the speaker.”The university said that security was expected to cost 00,000, far more than the 0,500 it is receiving from Mr. Spencer’s group to rent space on campus. But the university said it could not legally pass the security costs on to the National Policy Institute.What about protests?Far-right activists and counterprotesters have clashed in or around other campuses, including the <uname>University of California, Berkeley</uname>, <uname>Evergreen State College</uname> in Washington State and the <uname>University of Virginia</uname>. The counterprotesters have often been led by Antifa, or anti-fascists, wearing black masks and sometimes wielding pepper spray and other weapons.The Orlando Antifa has alerted followers to Mr. Spencer’s appearance at the <uname>University of Florida</uname>. It reacted to the announcement that the National Guard was being mobilized with a tweet, “Remember the last time the national guard was invited to a university campus? #NoNazisAtUF.” The message was accompanied by the famous photo of an anguished woman kneeling over the body of a <uname>Kent State University</uname> student shot dead by the National Guard during a protest against the Vietnam War in 1970.
