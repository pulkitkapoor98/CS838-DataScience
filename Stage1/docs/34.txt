 With just one parking space for every five people, on a campus of roughly 65,000, the <uname>University of Wisconsin-Madison</uname> has one of the lowest parking ratios of any major university in the country.To reduce the number of cars on campus, parking permits are off limits to students, who are instead encouraged to walk, bike or take the bus.Because visitors to the 936-acre campus often have a hard time finding parking, the university’s latest master plan, nearing completion, recommends an additional 2,200 spaces over the next 20 to 40 years. But Gary A. Bishop, the director of campus planning, is reluctant to add any spaces right away. When Mr. Bishop looks into the future, he sees a campus even more reliant on ride-hailing services like Uber and car-sharing services like Zipcar, as well as the likely emergence of autonomous vehicles, trends that could substantially decrease parking demand.
 Some universities are building mixed-use garages, which can be a more efficient use of land and help ensure maximal use of spaces. <uname>Northwestern University</uname>, in Evanston, Ill., has built two mixed-use garages in recent years, as part of a plan to move parking to the periphery of campus and free up more interior land for green space.A 1,125-space garage at the north end of campus houses an entrepreneurship incubator known as the Garage, as well as a speech and hearing clinic open to the community. At the south end, a 435-space garage designed by Perkins &amp; Will is home to the Segal Visitors Center. The building uses limestone and glass facades on the sides facing campus, and a facade with canvas, sail-like elements facing Lake Michigan and the university’s sailing center.“We believe that it doesn’t really make sense to have space that is just for cars,” said Alan K. Cubbage, the vice president for university relations. “You want to use the space in a thoughtful way.”
