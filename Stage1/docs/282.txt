 GroupMe, it should be said, is a text client like WhatsApp that allows a user to be added to multiple group chats that vary in size from two to 200 members. A group chat over text message requires personal phone numbers or email addresses, but GroupMe is much easier: You can join or be added to different chats using a public Facebook or Google account.The key to the app’s convenience is also its downside: A person who is a friend of yours on Facebook can add you to a GroupMe chat without your consent.Last November, news of the “Mud Men” chat spread like wildfire.Students started noticing the racist chat on the morning of Nov. 11 when freshmen who were targeted posted screenshots of the threats on Twitter, Facebook and Snapchat, forcing students inside the <uname>Penn</uname> bubble — and plenty outside of it — to pay attention. Black organizations sent a barrage of emails and texts to their constituencies about the situation and began to plan for an emergency town hall. By the afternoon, the news had been picked up by national civil rights activists, including Shaun King and DeRay Mckesson. The news was trending on Twitter for hours before the school issued an official response.There was a palpable uncertainty in the air that day. Was the chat to be taken as a serious threat to the well-being of <uname>Penn</uname>’s black freshmen and in turn, <uname>Penn</uname>’s black community? Or was it a joke that got too serious to take back? The motive is still unclear, but the incident certainly made students fearful.
