 The university was clear in its condemnation of hate and hate speech on <uname>Penn</uname>’s campus, but the official response came after news had spread to local law enforcement and the media, and after students of color had already met to debrief and discuss the situation.That problem is not exclusive to the <uname>University of Pennsylvania</uname>: Many schools are unable to keep up with how quickly the world moves in this digital era.Don’t get me wrong: Some of the key supporters of black student groups were faculty members who were instrumental in making sure that everyone felt safe and supported and that proper resources were being applied to figuring out who was responsible for the chat’s existence. I just wish that the university had taken steps publicly to support its black students much sooner than it did.
