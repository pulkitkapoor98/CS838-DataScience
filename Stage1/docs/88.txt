 — If you agree that digital literacy alone would not have prevented those students from posting what they did, what do you think might have helped those students, and what might help them in the future? Samuel DuBois Cook, a lifelong educator who was widely saluted as the first tenure-track black professor appointed by a predominantly white university in the South since Reconstruction, died on May 29 at his home in Atlanta.

Dr. Martin Luther King Jr., he was 88.His death was announced by <uname>Duke University</uname>, where he taught political science from 1966 to 1974 before serving 22 years as president of <uname>Dillard University</uname>, a historically black institution in New Orleans. No cause of death was given.If there were any doubts about how the first full-time black professor would fare at a Southern university whose student body had only just been integrated, they were quickly dispelled.

Marcus Emanuel Cook, was a Baptist minister. His mother was the former Mary Beatrice Daniel.The summer after high school, Samuel Cook and his friend Martin Luther King Jr. were sent by their fathers, both preachers, to work in Connecticut’s tobacco fields to earn money for college. That fall, as precocious 15-year-old freshmen, they entered <uname>Morehouse</uname> under an early-admissions program aimed at filling classrooms emptied by students drafted for World War II.Dr. Cook is survived by his wife, the former Sylvia Fields; their children, Samuel Jr. and Karen J. Cook; and two grandchildren.In 1948, he graduated with a bachelor’s degree in history from <uname>Morehouse</uname>, where he was student body president and founded the campus chapter of the N.A.A.C.P.He earned a master’s (in political science) and a doctorate from <uname>Ohio State University</uname>.
