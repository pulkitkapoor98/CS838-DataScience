 But policy experts also said that Mr. Trump’s suggestion that vocational education was the silver bullet to the country’s work force deficit was misguided.Michelle Asha Cooper, the president of the Institute for Higher Education Policy, noted that labor economists estimated that in 2020, of the millions of jobs created, two-thirds would require postsecondary degree.“While bricklayers are an important part of our labor market, I think we have to recognize that vocational schools are not going to solve our work force needs alone,” Ms. Cooper said. “It’s not a purposeful discussion to say vocational schools can do it all, because statistically, it cannot be done.”Community colleges were also on the defensive after the president’s remarks.The role of community colleges was crystallized in 1947, when President Harry Truman ordered a Presidential Commission on Higher Education to re-examine the higher education landscape after veterans came home from World War II to find traditional colleges crowded.“The name used does not matter, though ‘community college’ seems to describe these schools best,” the commission wrote. “The important thing is that the services they perform be recognized and vastly extended.”In the 1960s, <uname>Portland Community College</uname> answered that call, its president, Mark Mitsui, said.The school covers 1,500 square miles and serves 76,000 students over four campuses. Students from high schools can enroll, but the average age of the student body is 29 because the school serves a range of functions, like allowing students to take a traditional college curriculum that affords them transfers to Ivy Leagues or offering basic skills and English-language courses.Its graduates include the author Rebecca Skloot, who wrote the best-selling book “The Immortal Life of Henrietta Lacks.”“We respond to the needs of our community, and the community’s needs are complex, so we want to be as comprehensive as possible,” Mr. Mitsui said. “I think our communities do know what we do and represent. There are a lot of bridges in Portland, and we are a bridge to opportunity.”
