 The Association of American Universities, which represents 60 research universities, including <uname>Carnegie Mellon</uname>, said the tax plan threatened the viability of their doctoral programs. The universities award nearly one-half of all American doctoral degrees and 55 percent of those in the sciences and engineering.Its president, Mary Sue Coleman, said the tax proposals “will have dire consequences for Americans who rely on research universities for undergraduate and graduate education.”If approved, the tax plan could take effect Jan. 1, a fast-approaching deadline for the thousands of families who would face unanticipated tuition bills.“If I had to pay it, it would have been a killer,” said Mr. Vautour.When he started at <uname>Boston College</uname> as a cook in 1994, he was making 0.65 an hour, and full-time tuition was about 5,000. His salary has doubled after 18 years and so has the college’s tuition, which now stands at 2,500. His children rounded out their financial aid with scholarships and small federal loans, and Mr. Vautour paid only about ,000 per year for other expenses.
