 Each winter, dental hygiene students from <uname>Dalhousie University</uname> in Halifax, Nova Scotia, head up to the remote Labrador village of Forteau (population: about 450). The clinic there does not have the funding for a dental hygienist.The students provide the majority of oral hygiene and education for the community. The students also see stark contrasts with what they would normally encounter in more-affluent communities (patients with tobacco staining, for example).The graduates of this internship are prepared for jobs in major Canadian population centers, although interestingly, the four Dalhousie dental hygiene students who went to Forteau this winter said they would prefer to practice in rural areas when they graduated.
 Peter Haubrich, a first-generation college student, graduated from the <uname>Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology</uname> in Boston last year with a bachelorâ€™s degree in health information technology and landed a job five months later.
