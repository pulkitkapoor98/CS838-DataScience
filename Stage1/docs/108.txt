 That “is tied as directly as possible to institutional financial health,” said George L. Mehaffy, vice president for academic leadership and change at the American Association of State Colleges and Universities, which is involved in the project. “If you increase the number of students you retain and graduate, it dramatically affects your bottom line.”He cites one program pioneered at <uname>Georgia State University</uname> that gives “microgrants” from a few hundred dollars to ,000 to help financially struggling students overcome setbacks that often derail their educations. It costs the university  million, but more than pays for itself by avoiding the even higher price tag of replacing dropouts. (Retention rates nationally have edged up by two percentage points since 2009 as colleges and universities invest more resources in student support.)
