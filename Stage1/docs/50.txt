 The whole conversation about the plaque took place months ago, she said, and the university was bound by a confidentiality agreement.Ms. Doe has remained an invisible presence throughout the public debate over the plaque, which ignited in recent weeks after Ms. Dauber spoke to news organizations. Ms. Doe could not be reached for comment, and has not spoken about it to other news outlets. Her lawyer did not respond to messages Tuesday.Professor Dauber said that, with Ms. Doe’s support, she proposed placing a plaque at the site of the assault and that the university agreed to do so in September 2016.Ms. Doe’s lawyer, Professor Dauber and university officials discussed the potential engraving, Ms. Lapin said, but they could not agree on which quotation to use from Ms. Doe’s statement.It has been three years since Ms. Doe was sexually assaulted outside near a garbage collection structure by Brock Turner, a <uname>Stanford</uname> swimmer, on the school’s campus in January 2015.Mr. Turner was found guilty of three felony counts of sexual assault and served jail time for three months of his six-month sentence. He was released in September 2016. The sentence, far short of the maximum 14 years, spurred protests and calls for the judge in the case to be recalled. Professor Dauber, the chairwoman of a committee to recall the judge, has been central to that effort.
 Ms. Doe provided <uname>Stanford</uname> with a quotation from her 7,000-word victim impact statement, which was shared by millions of people online after it was posted in June 2016. After the school refused that quotation, it also refused her second choice, Professor Dauber said.
