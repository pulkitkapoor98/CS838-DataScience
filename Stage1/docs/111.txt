 A 2015 study by the Congressional Research Service found that in the previous fiscal year, colleges spent an average of 4.4 percent of their endowments, and the average rate of investment return was 15.5 percent. Larger institutions, which were more invested in hedge funds and private equity, had higher returns.<uname>Yale</uname>’s endowment was nearly  million per student that year. <uname>Princeton</uname>’s was more than .6 million, and <uname>Harvard</uname>’s was nearly .3 million, according to the study. <uname>Harvard</uname> alone held 7 percent of all endowment assets that year, the report said.At <uname>Cornell</uname>, the  endowment typically goes toward financial aid, or helping cover faculty salaries and research, the president, Martha E. Pollack, said on Friday. If the tax goes through, <uname>Cornell</uname> would have to make the money up somewhere else, she said.“This is very very serious for us; we’re estimating at this point that it would cost us approximately 0.5 million a year,” Dr. Pollack said. “And, as far as I can tell, it doesn’t satisfy any real policy objectives. It’s just a transfer of money from universities to permit a tax cut elsewhere in the system.”
 Among the hundreds of sexual-abuse victims of the former U.S.A. Gymnastics doctor Lawrence G. Nassar, the ones who have received the most attention have been brand-name Olympians, such as McKayla Maroney, Aly Raisman and Simone Biles, and those who say their abuse dates back to especially young ages — 12, 9, even 6.But a subset of the more than 256 reported victims whom the <uname>Michigan</uname> attorney general’s office counted last week were <uname>Michigan State</uname> athletes at the time they say they were abused. Their stories provide a stark window into how Dr. Nassar was able to capitalize on his status and reputation, the credibility of his university and even the inherent pressure of college sports to exploit adult women even after questions about his conduct had been raised.The <uname>Michigan State</uname> athletes, who were conditioned to compete and proudly represent the Spartans against N.C.A.A. rivals and on national stages, say they are still coming to terms with what many said was the university’s negligence in enabling a predator.“You assume you’re going to get the best, because they want the best out of you,” said Natalie Stein, a distance runner from the Los Angeles area who said Dr. Nassar twice performed a “mild” version of his distinctive intravaginal massage treatment on her in the spring of 2004.
