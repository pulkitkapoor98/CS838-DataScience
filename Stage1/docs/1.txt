 When Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo announced the Excelsior scholarship program offering free tuition to New York’s public colleges and universities last year, many of New York’s private colleges worried that they would lose prospective students. And, indeed, in November, a survey released by the Commission on Independent Colleges and Universities, which represents private nonprofit colleges in the state, found that freshmen enrollment at the schools by New York residents slipped 6 percent in the fall of 2017.But in the middle of admissions season, the state’s private schools say their numbers are up, despite the price competition from Excelsior, which the governor last week credited with increasing applications to <uname>State University of New York</uname> and <uname>City University of New York</uname> affiliated schools by 10 percent. The growth, he said, was “proof positive that students are seizing this unprecedented opportunity.”<uname>SUNY</uname> and <uname>CUNY</uname> increases actually pale in comparison to some of the private colleges, including smaller ones that mostly draw from within the state. At <uname>Hartwick College</uname>, less than a mile from <uname>SUNY</uname> Oneonta in the Catskills, freshman applications for the fall of 2018 are up by 43 percent over all, and 41 percent among New York state residents. At <uname>St. Lawrence University</uname>, located about 20 miles from the Canadian border, applications have climbed 12 percent, reversing a drop from the previous year. And at <uname>Alfred University</uname> in southwestern New York, near the Pennsylvania border, applications have risen 14 percent to a record high, while deposits have increased 30 percent.In response to Excelsior, many of the schools have begun new scholarships, or are making efforts to highlight their advantages over the public institutions and target prospective students.
 The Excelsior scholarship is the nation’s first to cover tuition for students at two and four-year public schools, and could reduce the cost of a degree from a four-year <uname>SUNY</uname> school — now almost 3,000 for tuition, fees, room and board — by about 6,000. As a “last dollar” program reminiscent of a successful effort in Tennessee for community colleges, the New York program comes into play after other scholarships and grants — like federal Pell grants or the state’s generous Tuition Assistance Program, both of which go the lowest-income students — are already taken into account.Under the program, recipients’ families cannot make an adjusted gross income of more than 10,000 for the 2018-19 academic year and students are required to stay in New York for as many years as they received the awards, or risk having the grant be converted into a loan. Critics say that focusing solely on tuition penalizes the poorest students, who often need help with living expenses, books and fees that are not covered by Excelsior.About 23,000 students are now benefiting from Excelsior.“We believe that Gov. Cuomo’s Excelsior Scholarship played a significant role in the increases in applications, enrollment and credit-taking by enabling eligible students to attend tuition-free,” James B. Milliken, <uname>CUNY</uname>’s chancellor, said in a statement.
