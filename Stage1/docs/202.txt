 That determination is important and overdue. But it’s hardly universal, partly because there is and always has been disagreement about the very mission of higher education. Should it grapple with the world as it is or point the way to the world as it should be?Even before Trump’s election, there was welling discussion about the ideological uniformity of many colleges, where the left holds bold and sometimes imperious sway.In 2013 the <uname>University of Colorado, Boulder</uname>, welcomed its first “visiting scholar in conservative thought,” a teaching position created to bring someone from the right to the school each year. In 2015 Jonathan Haidt, a justly celebrated social psychologist at <uname>New York University</uname>, helped to found the Heterodox Academy, an organization that promotes intellectual diversity in higher education.And a growing number of educators have been wondering aloud if there should be “affirmative action” for conservative professors, given the hugely disproportionate percentage of liberal faculty in the humanities and social sciences. They often conclude that outright preferences are a bad idea but that creating an extra position in, say, military history rather than gender studies would probably up the odds of adding a Republican to the lineup.Trump’s election at once imperiled and emboldened this movement. To some college administrators and instructors, it was proof that the barbarians were at the gate and that students needed safe spaces more than ever. Understanding what happened on Nov. 8 was less important than fighting furiously against it.
