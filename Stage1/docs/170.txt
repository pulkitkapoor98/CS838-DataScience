 Dr. Heatherton leads a center for social brain sciences and, according to the college’s website, conducts research in social behavior focusing on self-regulation, self-esteem and self-referential processing. He had been an unpaid visiting scholar at <uname>New York University</uname> since July, with no classroom duties, but his time there ended last Thursday “by mutual agreement,” according to John H. Beckman, an <uname>NYU</uname> spokesman.“<uname>NYU</uname> was unaware of the <uname>Dartmouth</uname> investigation until quite recently,” Mr. Beckman said. “The university was given no specifics about its nature or duration.”Dr. Kelley’s work focuses on memory and self-regulation, according to the website.Dr. Heatherton and Dr. Kelley were among the authors of a 2012 research study on how images of food and sex affect the brain. As part of the research, 58 female college freshmen underwent brain scans shortly after arrival on campus while viewing 80 images each of animals, environmental scenes, food items and people — some involved in sexual scenes or consuming alcohol. Six months later, they were called back to the lab, weighed and questioned on their sexual behavior.The study, published in the Journal of Neuroscience, found that the students whose brains reacted to food and sexual stimuli gained more weight and reported greater sexual desire in the follow-up questioning. The study was supported by the <uname>National Institute of Drug Abuse</uname>. Dr. Whalen was listed as having assisted in that study.Dr. Whalen, a popular professor who delivered a TedXDartmouth talk, runs the Whalen Lab, which conducts research on a part of the brain known as the amygdala. His published research papers include a collaboration with Drs. Kelley and Heatherton and others on the question of whether the brains of men and women react differently to attractive facial features in members of the opposite sex. That paper was published in 2008 in the Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.
