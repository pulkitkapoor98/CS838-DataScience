 A school like <uname>Golden Gate</uname> should be a model for how other institutions can adapt to the newer, older face of American college students. The problem for for-profits is that doing the job right just isn’t very profitable, while elite nonprofit colleges face little pressure to recruit adult students. Schools like <uname>Stanford</uname> and <uname>Yale</uname> could fill each freshman class exclusively with upper-middle-class 18-year-olds if they wanted (and they basically do).Compounding the problem is that the best-known arbiters of college quality, like US-News &amp; World Report, reward schools for prestige and selectivity, not for serving the needs of adults and all the other students who actually make up most of America’s college classrooms.That’s a shame. Elite universities pride themselves on creating diverse learning environments, but by ignoring adult students, they’re missing out on a tremendous opportunity to bring different perspectives into the classroom. Schools like <uname>Princeton</uname> and the <uname>University of Chicago</uname> train a disproportionate share of future leaders in government and business. Shouldn’t those groups include students who have, say, worked as a nurse in an ICU., or supervised a factory floor, or trained combat troops as an noncommissioned officer? And shouldn’t the 18-year-old future leaders of America interact with and learn from people with those experiences?One might object that seats at highly selective universities are so rare and valuable that they should be reserved strictly for the young, whose whole lives are ahead of them. But if elite universities expanded the size of their incoming classes — something few of them have done in decades despite soaring demand — adult students could be accommodated without younger ones being displaced.In our reporting on adult learners, we found schools around the country — ones with far fewer resources than most elite private universities — that are developing innovative ways to make college work better for the grown-ups they serve. <uname>Broward College</uname>, in Florida, for instance, now has courses in which students earn not only college credit but industry certifications to guarantee that they are job-ready, while <uname>Southern New Hampshire University</uname> offers fully online bachelor’s degrees that adults can earn quickly by demonstrating mastery of knowledge and skills that they picked up on the job.
