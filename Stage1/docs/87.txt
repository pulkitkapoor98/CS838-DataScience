 Once they start taking college-credit classes, nearly three-quarters of the eligible students will enroll in another <uname>CUNY</uname> initiative, called Accelerated Study in Associate Programs, which I’ve written about in the past. The package includes financial help, carefully constructed class schedules and one-on-one advising. Sixty-four percent of ASAP students earned a degree within six years.Educators elsewhere are paying attention; colleges in upstate New York, Ohio and California are starting their own ASAP initiatives. And a group of New York City high school teachers are, in a pilot program, being trained in <uname>CUNY</uname> Start’s model of teaching. It’s the classic ounce-of-prevention approach — improve teaching in high school, so students won’t have to take remedial math in college.<uname>CUNY</uname> Start and ASAP aren’t <uname>City University</uname>’s only success stories. Researchers at <uname>Stanford</uname>, <uname>Berkeley</uname> and <uname>Brown</uname> universities have shown that <uname>CUNY</uname> is a more powerful engine of mobility than almost any university in the nation. Places like <uname>CUNY</uname>, <uname>Stony Brook University</uname> and <uname>California State University, Los Angeles</uname>, are the workhorses of higher education, and they’re doing a fine job.
 I am of the bridge generation that remembers life before social media permeated everything, but cannot imagine life without it now. I was a sophomore at the <uname>University of Illinois</uname> in 2004, the year “TheFacebook” launched and was made available to college students who went to Ivy League and Big 10 schools. I signed up for the new social network, and never looked back (except shadily) at BlackPlanet or Myspace.
