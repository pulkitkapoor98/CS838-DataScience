 Myth 5: It’s important to choose a major early.Why settle on a field of study before experiencing the smorgasbord college has to offer, be it study abroad, a club activity or a surprising elective?Of students who said they felt committed to their major when they arrived on campus, 20 percent had selected a new major by the end of their first year, according to a national survey by the <uname>University of California, Los Angeles</uname>.Changing majors can cost you a semester or two, especially if you switch to one unrelated to your first choice. To reduce that risk, several schools, including <uname>Arizona State University</uname>, <uname>Georgia State University</uname> and <uname>Lehman College</uname> in the Bronx, have created “meta-majors,” which group majors under a larger academic umbrella.“We have moved away from trying to get students to choose their majors as they enter,” said Timothy Renick, <uname>Georgia State</uname>’s vice provost and vice president for enrollment management and student success.Instead, all incoming students choose from one of seven meta-majors, representing large academic and work force fields, such as business, education and STEM. First semester, students gather in learning communities and register for a block of general-education courses within that meta-major. Programming is designed so that students get to know the differences between majors within the field.“Students in our business meta-major get to understand the difference between finance, accounting, management and marketing so they can choose their major from an informed perspective,” Dr. Renick said. They usually do by the end of their first year.Myth 6: You need a major.A handful of colleges, including <uname>Indiana University</uname> and the <uname>Evergreen State College</uname>, offer the option to ignore the official list of majors and design a course of study. Will Shortz, the crossword puzzle editor for The Times, designed his at <uname>Indiana</uname> — enigmatology.“Majors are artificial and restrictive,” said Christine Ortiz, a dean at the <uname>Massachusetts Institute of Technology</uname> on leave to design a new nonprofit university that will have no majors, and also no lectures or classrooms.
 Majors tend to lag behind changes in the workplace. No wonder fewer than a third of college graduates work in jobs related to their majors. And picking one based on today’s in-demand jobs is risky, said Dr. Webber of <uname>Temple</uname>, especially if the occupation is threatened by automation.“I would argue against majoring in accounting,” he said, “or anything that a computer can be programmed to do.”
