 Dr. Coico arrived with much fanfare in 2010 as the first <uname>CUNY</uname> alumna to serve as president of <uname>City College</uname>, which was established in 1847. With a background in microbiology and immunobiology, she was expected to lead an ambitious expansion of the college’s science offerings, and to continue its recent fund-raising success.But she was a polarizing figure, and presided over a campus that endured punishing budget cuts. In 2015, for instance, the college imposed a 10 percent budget reduction, citing increasing personnel costs, even though cuts at other <uname>CUNY</uname> schools were closer to 3 percent.Last summer, around the time The New York Times raised questions about whether more than 50,000 of her personal expenses had been paid improperly by a university research foundation, federal prosecutors began an investigation of Ms. Coico. In October, she resigned, one day after The Times presented new evidence to the college suggesting that a memo related to those expenses had been fabricated, possibly to mislead prosecutors.William C. Thompson Jr., the chairman of <uname>CUNY</uname>’s Board of Trustees and a former New York City comptroller, subsequently asked for a thorough investigation of all “foundations, alumni associations or other affiliated entities” at <uname>City College</uname>.Not long afterward, Catherine Leahy Scott, the New York State inspector general, criticized <uname>CUNY</uname>’s financial practices as “ripe for abuse” in an unusual interim report, prompting Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo to demand sweeping changes.In June, <uname>CUNY</uname>’s board approved a plan to centralize oversight of the foundations. But the ongoing vacancy at <uname>City College</uname> had generated enough concern that Mr. Milliken, in an unusual letter, cautioned that the search for a new president would take longer than anticipated.
