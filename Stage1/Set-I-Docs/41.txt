 Following other universities across the country, <uname>New York University</uname> announced on Thursday that it will offer free tuition next semester to about 50 students from Puerto Rico whose studies were interrupted by Hurricane Maria. <uname>NYU</uname> began accepting applications on Thursday and will accept students into its undergraduate programs on a rolling basis. In addition to tuition, admitted students will receive free housing, health insurance and a meal plan.“The situation in Puerto Rico is obviously something that we’ve all been watching with great concern over the last several weeks,” said Andrew Hamilton, the president of the university. “We’re pleased to be able to do this.”Full-time tuition at <uname>NYU</uname>, which is 5,232 for 2017-18 school year, will be waived for the students. However, the students will have to pay their spring semester tuition to their home universities.
 In making the move, <uname>NYU</uname> joins several school districts, colleges and universities across the country bracing themselves for an influx of students forced from Puerto Rico by Hurricane Maria. In fact, partly because of a decade-long exodus to the mainland, enrollment at Puerto Rican universities declined by about 7 percent from 2010 to 2016, according to the Education Council of Puerto Rico.Elite universities like <uname>Brown University</uname>, <uname>Cornell University</uname> and <uname>Tulane University</uname> have all offered tuition-free semesters to displaced students. And students from Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands who attend the <uname>State University of New York</uname> will pay in-state tuition this school year.Hurricane Maria disrupted the higher education system in Puerto Rico. University buildings across the island sustained damage. Entire campuses were left without water and electricity. Students’ fall semesters were disrupted, and academic calenders were thrown into a frenzy.
