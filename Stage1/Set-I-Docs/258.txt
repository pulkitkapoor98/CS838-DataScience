  Do you have a spine-tingling story to share about your school or alma mater? Submit it here, and we’ll publish our favorites in time for Halloween.During my sophomore year, I lived in a haunted dorm.I’ll admit, I have always loved a good ghost story. So you could say I was primed to have a ghost sighting, or at least, hopeful for one. And at <uname>Kenyon College</uname> in Ohio, where I went to school, ghosts are a big part of campus lore.Every October, the security guards host a bonfire and recount, straight-faced, tales of disappearing footprints, disembodied wails and an elevator that operated on its own. One professor leads a haunted campus tour, and <uname>Kenyon</uname> alumni from different generations share versions of the stories at reunions and gatherings; it’s part of our shared language and a useful conversation starter.The stories themselves are regularly embellished, and some have taken on mythic proportions, but the original tales come from a handful of tragic accidents over the last century.
