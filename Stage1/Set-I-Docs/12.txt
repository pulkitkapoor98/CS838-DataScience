 The director of <uname>MIT</uname>’s Digital Currency Initiative, Neha Narula, said that when it didn’t schedule a course for this semester, she got constant requests from students. So she put one together and is now co-teaching it.“Students are just fascinated with this area,” she said. “They want to learn about it desperately.”
 “Controversies over freedom of speech on college campuses have existed as long as there have been college campuses. But the specific issues vary with each generation.”That is the first line of Erwin Chemerinsky’s new book, “Free Speech on Campus,” written with Howard Gillman. Mr. Chemerinsky is not only one of the foremost legal scholars on the First Amendment but also a firsthand witness to the free speech debates of today as the new dean of the <uname>University of California Berkeley</uname> school of law.Here he talks with Natalie Shutler, the editor of the On Campus column, about hate speech, censorship and what campuses can and can’t do. This interview has been edited and condensed.Natalie Shutler: Hi, Professor! I have spent the past year talking with college students about free speech and, as you know all too well, it’s a contentious topic for them. In this loud internet age, in which provocative opinions are hitting us constantly and from all sides, plenty of students don’t see value in hosting more of the same on their campuses. One thing I appreciate about your new book is that you are thoughtful about these students’ concerns, even if you disagree with their conclusions.
