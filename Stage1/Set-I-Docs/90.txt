 An earlier version of this obituary misstated the position for which Dr. Cook was hired by <uname>Duke University</uname>. It was associate professor, not assistant professor.    
 The <uname>City University of New York</uname>, troubled by federal and state investigations, plans to overhaul the rules governing its affiliated nonprofit foundations as part of an effort to reassure alumni and donors.If adopted, the guidelines would give <uname>CUNY</uname>, the largest public urban university in the country, more control over a sprawling network of more than two dozen funds that last year gave 50 million to the university and collectively have more than 00 million in assets, according to tax records. The New York Times obtained a draft of the new rules.The changes are being proposed as federal prosecutors in Brooklyn expand their investigation into several <uname>CUNY</uname> foundations, including two associated with the <uname>City College of New York</uname>, the universityâ€™s flagship school, for their handling of federal research money and personal expenses.The former president of City College, Lisa S. Coico, resigned abruptly in October after The New York Times contacted officials with questions about more than 50,000 of her personal expenses, which had improperly been paid by the <uname>CUNY</uname> Research Foundation. A memo concerning her expenses seemed to have been fabricated, apparently to deceive prosecutors.
