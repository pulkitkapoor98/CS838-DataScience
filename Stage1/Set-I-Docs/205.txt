 Perhaps you’re wondering how Betsy DeVos is doing.Or maybe not, unless you’re planning to go to a Halloween party dressed as the secretary of education.DeVos is the superrich Republican donor who once led a crusade to reform troubled Michigan public schools by turning them into truly terrible private ones. Now she’s in the Trump cabinet, and she seems to be dedicating a lot of her time to, um, lowering higher education.“When no one was watching she hired a lot of people that come from the for-profit colleges,” complained Senator Patty Murray of Washington, who feels the additions are far more interested in protecting their old associates than in overseeing them. Murray is the top Democrat on the Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee, otherwise known as HELP. These days it’s hard to tell whether that’s a promise of assistance or a cry of distress.To oversee the critical issue of fraud in higher education, DeVos picked Julian Schmoke Jr., whose former job was a dean of — yes! — a for-profit university. Specifically a school named <uname>DeVry</uname>. Last year, under fire from state prosecutors and the Federal Trade Commission, <uname>DeVry</uname> agreed to pay 00 million to students who complained that they had been misled by its recruitment pitch.
