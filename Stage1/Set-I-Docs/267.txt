 At several points during the inaudible lecture, protesters turned off the lights and displayed a projection with the words “white supremacist” on the wall with an arrow, pointing down at Mr. Murray. Others held signs: “We punch white supremacists!” and “Nazis go away.” Over a dozen <uname>University of Michigan</uname> police officers stood by. No one was removed from the event.Finally, after some 45 minutes of pandemonium, which included a graduate student protester taking to the stage and co-opting the lectern from Mr. Murray, the protesters marched out of the event en masse. Mr. Murray spent the remainder of his time lecturing on what he was invited to speak about: The 2016 election and how we got stuck with President Trump, whom Mr. Murray fiercely opposes.The argument of Mr. Murray’s latest book is that the nation is “coming apart at the seams” largely because of class. The elites and the people of “flyover country,” as he refers to it, have diverged so far that they barely recognize their underlying American kinship.Something very similar can be said of college campuses like my own. What last night’s reaction to Mr. Murray demonstrates so powerfully is that they are coming apart as well, not over class but over a deep intellectual intolerance for any voice that falls to the right of the center. “The reason universities exist is so we can have calm, logical exchanges about differences of opinion,” Mr. Murray said to the crowd at one point. But increasingly, my fellow students don’t seem to believe that.We weren’t naïve in inviting Mr. Murray to campus. We knew that he was one of the authors of “The Bell Curve.” We knew what happened at Middlebury.
