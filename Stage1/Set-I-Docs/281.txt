 Is there a difference between “real life” and the digital realm?I’ve heard parents and professors talk about these worlds as distinct, but for young people who have grown up with the internet, they are one and the same.One thing that hasn’t been acknowledged enough is how the generation gap has been widened by rapid technological change, especially in regard to social media. The internet is integral to almost every aspect of the lives of young people. The social problems that unfold online are just as real to us as those that happen face to face.In college, this generational social media gap has become a source of misunderstanding and miscommunication between students and administrators. If a problem among students is playing out online, administrators may not know how to help for a number of reasons: They may see the problem as relegated to the digital realm. Or they may not know how the app or platform in question even works.I first became aware of this issue last November when black students at the <uname>University of Pennsylvania</uname>, where I am a junior, were targeted on a messaging app called GroupMe.
