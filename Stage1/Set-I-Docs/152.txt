 According to faculty minutes of the <uname>Medical College of Georgia</uname> from an 1852 meeting, the dean of the college purchased Harris at a Charleston, S.C., auction for 00, equivalent to about 2,000 today.Baker was born at the <uname>Medical College of Virginia</uname> (<uname>Virginia Commonwealth University</uname> today) to enslaved parents who worked at the college. Thus the school did not need to purchase him â€” being born to an enslaved woman meant he, too, was enslaved. Both men were central in acquiring cadavers used for dissection.Having the two body snatchers in the building where anatomy professors taught and performed dissections gave the schools an advantage in recruiting. The medical colleges boasted about their ample supplies of subjects for dissection, a necessary component for training in human anatomy.Enslaved people like Harris and Baker who were forced to rob graves were complicated and important historical figures, and their stories remind us we have much to learn from the legacy of slavery in the United States.
