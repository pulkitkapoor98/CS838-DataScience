 Describing themselves as “extremely disappointed,” a group of prominent political, religious and community leaders from Harlem is lodging an unexpected 11th-hour protest against the expected next president of the <uname>City College of New York</uname>.Former Gov. David A. Paterson, former Representative Charles B. Rangel and former Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright were among 20 people named in an email sent to The New York Times over the weekend after a report indicating that Vincent G. Boudreau, the college’s interim president, would be given the permanent post on Monday.The email criticized James B. Milliken, the chancellor of the <uname>City University of New York</uname>, the college’s parent entity, as well as William C. Thompson Jr., chairman of <uname>CUNY</uname>’s Board of Trustees, for failing to include their “input, insight and influence” in the search process.The email also criticized Dr. Boudreau, a political scientist and 26-year veteran of the college who previously served as the dean of the <uname>Colin Powell School</uname>. Dr. Boudreau, they claimed without corroboration, had initially been deemed “unworthy of this post” by the search committee, which took more than a year, or longer than anticipated, to do its work.
