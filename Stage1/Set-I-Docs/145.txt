 Mr. Aubin, from Oak Lawn, Ill., was then a high school senior hoping to attend <uname>Yale</uname>. The following prompt caught his eye: “A community to which you belong and the footprint you have left.” He submitted a short video documenting his Eagle Scout project, for which he oversaw the construction of a monument honoring veterans. Even a well-written essay, he figured, couldn’t capture his experience as well as four minutes of footage, shot by his older brother.The content of the video impressed <uname>Yale</uname>’s admissions committee. “People sat up in their chairs,” Mr. Quinlan said. “You could see how he handled his leadership role, and we felt like we got a good sense of him in a way that we didn’t get from recommendations.”Mr. Aubin is now a freshman at <uname>Yale</uname>.Did the video tip the scales? “That was a difference-maker,” Mr. Quinlan said.•Even as colleges consider innovation, it’s worth asking which fixtures of the admissions process, if any, they are willing to discard. Some prevalent practices seem to stand in the way of meaningful change.Giving an advantage to the sons and daughters of alumni is one such practice. Some colleges admit legacies (and the children of potential donors) at a much greater rate than non-legacies. Legacies make up nearly a third of <uname>Harvard</uname>’s current freshman class, The <uname>Harvard</uname> Crimson has reported. <uname>Princeton</uname>’s class of 2021 is 13 percent legacy, according to the university’s website.While a handful of prominent institutions, including the <uname>University of Georgia</uname> and <uname>Texas A&M University</uname>, stopped considering legacy status more than a decade ago, most colleges seem unlikely to remove that variable from the admissions equation anytime soon. “I don’t think an applicant’s legacy status is a crazy thing to look at, especially in the financial climate some colleges are in,” said Rick Clark, director of undergraduate admission at <uname>Georgia Tech</uname>, where nearly a fifth of freshmen are legacies. “Colleges have to think about their longevity.”The benefits of legacies go beyond maintaining good will with alumni who might open their wallets, Mr. Clark said. In his experience, they tend to be enthusiastic students who help foster community on campus, the kind of relationships that help other students feel at home and succeed. “Multigenerational ties to a place add value, creating this passionate, magnetic source of energy,” he said.
