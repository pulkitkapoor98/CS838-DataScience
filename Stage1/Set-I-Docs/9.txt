 For lawyers, virtual currency projects have challenged traditional legal categories and definitions of what constitutes a security or a commodity.Regulators have been caught flat-footed as entrepreneurs have raised billions of dollars by selling virtual currencies without going through the traditional fund-raising channels, taking advantage of the legal fuzziness surrounding them.For economists and business school professors, Bitcoin and other digital tokens have raised questions about the nature of money. The first lecture in the <uname>Berkeley</uname> class, for example, considered the development of Bitcoin against the history of money.Several business school classes are also focusing on the decentralized methods of record keeping and decision making introduced by Bitcoin.Bitcoin is given credit for creating the first blockchain, a ledger of transactions that is updated by a network of computers without relying on any central company or government.
