 Donations to City College’s main fund-raising arm, the 21st Century Foundation, are on track to be significantly lower this year, according to budget documents, reflecting unease among alumni and potential donors.The new guidelines were still being ironed out, and were subject to last-minute changes. They are part of a package of administrative reforms to be voted on by <uname>CUNY</uname>’s trustees, most of whom have been appointed by Gov. Andrew M. Cuomo, at their June 26 meeting — the last one before the next academic year.When asked about the guidelines, James B. Milliken, <uname>CUNY</uname>’s chancellor, confirmed that they were intended “to ensure transparency and accountability” to give “people confidence in the administration and governance of this university.”And while he said that the guidelines were “part of a larger plan that we’ve talked about, how to improve over all the operations of <uname>CUNY</uname>,” he also noted that outside investigations, one by the United States attorney for the Eastern District of New York, and the other by the New York State inspector general, had “identified and raised” important issues.“We want an environment that contributes to successful fund-raising and stewardship and that certainly includes an assurance to donors that their dollars are being invested wisely,” he said. “To the extent that it’s consistent with what the I.G. has identified, and others, all the better.”The overall impact of the new rules would be to centralize oversight of the foundations. They would have to open their records to <uname>CUNY</uname>, and would be subject to periodic audits by the university. Each foundation must enter into a new memo of understanding, which will outline the purpose of the fund, its personnel and the expectations of how it will operate. The university will also keep closer track of whether funds are being used as donors intended them.
 Every foundation “must accept and follow these guidelines” to ensure that it “operates in a prudent, lawful manner,” the draft reads. And one provision, which compels the foundations to open up their donor and alumni databases, seems specifically targeted at the City College Fund, which is also the subject of the federal investigation.The debate over the future of <uname>CUNY</uname> comes at a delicate time for the university.On the one hand, it has increasingly garnered recognition as a premier engine of upward mobility. On the other, states, including New York, have been cutting spending on public higher education while tuition has been climbing, and at <uname>CUNY</uname>, the lack of funding has contributed to deteriorating facilities and overcrowded classrooms.
