And Vicodin is ingested as a relaxant, available from students with prescriptions or on an online black market.Dr. Joseph Lee, medical director for youth services at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, says that students act as mixologists, creating dangerous drug and alcohol cocktails for themselves and friends. “They are alarmingly familiar with what they can do to get high, but not the danger,” he said, “and they don’t know where to get help.”Students in recovery confirm this.
