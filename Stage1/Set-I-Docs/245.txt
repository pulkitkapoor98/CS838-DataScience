 Richard B. Spencer, a prominent white nationalist, is scheduled to speak at the <uname>University of Florida</uname> on Thursday, prompting an outcry over whether his views are protected speech, dividing the campus and putting law enforcement officials on high alert.The university denied Mr. Spencer’s original request to speak on Sept. 12, citing the violent clashes in August between far-right demonstrators and counterprotesters in Charlottesville, Va., as well as threats on social media of a “blood bath” if the speech were allowed. But the university has since relented.On Monday, reacting to Mr. Spencer’s coming appearance, Gov. Rick Scott declared a state of emergency in Alachua County in North Florida, where the university is. The order helps coordinate law enforcement from various jurisdictions. The governor also activated the National Guard, so it can be called if necessary.The <uname>University of Florida</uname> president, Kent Fuchs, posted a YouTube message denouncing Mr. Spencer’s “message of hate and racism,” and urging students to stay away from his event and deprive Mr. Spencer of the attention he seeks.
