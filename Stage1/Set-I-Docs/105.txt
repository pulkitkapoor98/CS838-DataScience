 The very existence of the <uname>Benjamin Franklin Institute of Technology</uname> in Boston is a reminder that the challenge of maintaining a skilled work force is nothing new. Upon his death in 1790, Franklin left Boston an endowment to fund apprenticeships for young men under 25.“I believe good apprentices are likely to make good citizens,” he wrote in his will.That endowment was the seed money for what eventually became the college named in his honor. The college, in the city’s South End, offers two- and four-year degrees in high-demand fields like health information technology, computer technology and automotive technology (in the planning stages: a program in driverless-car technology).Peter Haubrich, 23, is in many ways a typical Franklin student. He graduated in May 2016 with a bachelor of science in health information technology. A first-generation college student, he was raised by his grandmother in the Roxbury section of Boston. Five months after graduation, Mr. Haubrich says he was hired by UnitedHealthcare to work in its division for a starting salary of 5,000 and a ,000 signing bonus.Mr. Haubrich said he is aware of the relationship of the college to Benjamin Franklin. “I knew his dough started the school,” he said. “Seems to me they’re definitely carrying out his mission.”
