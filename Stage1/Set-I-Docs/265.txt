 “You can say that the verdict was time served,” Chansky said, “because the last four to six years haven’t been fun at all.”Returning for his third go-round as tip-off master of ceremonies was Kenny Smith, the former <uname>North Carolina</uname> and N.B.A. player who co-hosts TNT’s popular N.B.A. pregame show.Smith was introduced as the Drake and Future song “Jumpman” played, which, as a nod to Nike and the university’s most famous alumnus, was a signal that business as usual had returned. (<uname>University of Kentucky</uname> fans attending Big Blue Madness that same evening got to see Drake in the flesh, wearing an instantly viral “<uname>Kentucky</uname> Dad” hoodie.)The hour that followed might have been dreary if you were not a Tar Heels die-hard (or even if you were). There were dances and controlled scrimmaging. Kennedy Meeks, a since-graduated star of last season’s team, was acknowledged in the stands. The introduction of the junior Luke Maye, who made a crucial shot to beat <uname>Kentucky</uname> in the round of 8 last season, provoked the crowd to rapture.Then the players lined up at center court as attention was drawn to the six championship banners hanging side by side on one side of the arena. As the end of last season’s title game played on the arena’s video screens, the years of the previous national titles, from 1924 to 2009, were counted off, and finally the 2017 banner was unfurled.It was perhaps a trick, a hallucination produced by the outpouring of meaning from 21,000 fans invested in the moment, that it immediately felt as if the new flag had always been there, and that it would never go away.
