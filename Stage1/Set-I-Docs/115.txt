 A lawyer representing Klages in civil lawsuits declined to comment.Achenbach received an athletic scholarship to run the mile for <uname>Michigan State</uname> in 1996. She said she visited Dr. Nassar in 1999 for an injury to her right hamstring.
 Like Achenbach, Hannum was recruited to <uname>Michigan State</uname>. Growing up in Andover, Mass., she had aspired to be an Olympic rower. At the time, <uname>Michigan State</uname> was a top-10 program. Beginning in high school, though, she said she experienced pain in her chest. It was later found to be thoracic outlet syndrome, in which blood vessels near the collarbone constrict. (Mets pitcher Matt Harvey has had the same issue.) Hannum had two surgeries to correct the problem, and Dr. Nassar treated her afterward, including after he disqualified her from competing for medical reasons.Hannum said Dr. Nassar would tell her she had popped a rib, then he would reach under her sports bra and massage her breasts. One time, she said, she noticed that he appeared to be physically aroused.Other physicians Hannum saw found the notion that she had a popped rib dubious. “Any time I would say that to another doctor, like when I was home, they would say, ‘That doesn’t make any sense,’” she said. “I’d say, ‘Well, it’s Dr. Nassar, he’s an Olympic doctor.’”All the athletes interviewed for this article said they tolerated Dr. Nassar’s conduct in part because they did not realize how inappropriate it was, and because both he and, in a sense, the university, held a certain power over them.
