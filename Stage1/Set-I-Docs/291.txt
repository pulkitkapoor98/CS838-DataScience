 Several universities also said they would revoke honorary degrees to the television news personality Charlie Rose.Large contributions to universities often come with the expectation that the donor’s name will be prominently displayed on a building, so the accusations against Mr. Wynn presented <uname>Penn</uname>, an Ivy League school in Philadelphia, with a particular conundrum.Students had already begun making their feelings known about Wynn Commons, an outdoor area on campus named for Mr. Wynn after he made a .5 million donation in 1995. A protest was planned for Friday, and earlier this week, the word “Wynn” was vandalized with black paint. The university quickly covered it up with plywood, with only the word “Commons” remaining visible. In an email to the campus community, the university president, Amy Gutmann, and the chairman of its board of trustees, David L. Cohen, said <uname>Penn</uname> had made the decision because “the nature, severity, and extent of these allegations, and the patterns of abusive behavior they describe, involve acts and conduct that are inimical to the core values of our university.”But that left the issue of Mr. Cosby. Allegations against Mr. Cosby, who faces criminal charges as well as lawsuits, have included claims that he drugged women to have sex with them, and that he sexually assaulted a woman on <uname>Penn</uname>’s campus during the <uname>Penn</uname> Relays track meet, where he was officiating in 2004.In 2015, the university rebuffed calls to revoke Mr. Cosby’s honorary degree. At that time, the university said that while the allegations against Mr. Cosby were deeply troubling, “it is not our practice to rescind honorary degrees.”Before Thursday, <uname>Penn</uname> had not rescinded an honorary degree in a century, since it took similar action against Kaiser Wilhelm II and Ambassador Johann Heinrich von Bernstorff of Germany during World War I.
