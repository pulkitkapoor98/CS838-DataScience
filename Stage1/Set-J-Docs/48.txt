 On Monday, Mr. Hamilton responded, saying the university would establish a more transparent process for dealing with visa denials, and urged the faculties to rethink the boycott. “The call to refrain from engagement is misplaced, not because the issue is not serious, but because it misses the mark, punishing students and faculty at <uname>NYU</uname> Abu Dhabi over a visa decision in which they had no hand and with which they disagree,” Mr. Hamilton wrote.But the response stopped short of criticizing Emirati authorities, the kind of condemnation <uname>NYU</uname> has been swift to issue in cases in which other regimes have appeared to target individuals, Professor Keshavarzian said. Much of the academic outcry stems from what is seen as a double standard in the school’s strong public stances in recent months about the Trump administration’s decisions on Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA, and its travel bans.“This project was created in the name of liberal education, of global outreach, of cosmopolitanism,” Professor Keshavarzian said. “This campus is developing a reputation that there are very real limits on who can teach and study at this university and what can be potentially said on this campus.”He added, “It suggests that there is a truly dysfunctional relationship, antithetical to the principles that <uname>NYU</uname> lauds and very publicly speaks out upon.”
 Between the academic years 2009-10 and 2015-16, 863 professors submitted applications for visas, and 10 were rejected, according to data compiled by the university and shared with The New York Times. During the same period, 2,874 other people associated with the university applied for visas, including members of the support staff, researchers and one student; 95 applications were rejected.By comparison, since the 2013-14 academic year, just one faculty member out of 254 bound for <uname>NYU</uname>’s Shanghai campus has been denied a work visa.It is the Emirati government, not the university, that oversees who gets work visas. The construction of the campus, which opened in 2010, was wholly funded by the government of Abu Dhabi, which also pays for many students’ scholarships.When the Abu Dhabi campus was announced in 2007, <uname>NYU</uname>’s president at the time, John Sexton, pledged that it would be “built with academic quality and practices conforming to the same standards as those at <uname>NYU</uname>’s Washington Square campus, including our standards of academic freedom.”
