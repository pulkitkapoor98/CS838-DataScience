 Ms. Cisneros, who is Mexican-American, described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious <uname>Iowa</uname> Writers’ Workshop when she began writing “The House on Mango Street.”She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word “little,” unaware how frequently the suffix “ito” — for little or cute — is used in Spanish.The incident, she said, impeded her connection to Spanish. “I didn’t realize it until after I’d left Iowa,” Ms. Cisneros said. “I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought, this is the voice of ‘The House on Mango Street.’”In her choice of a single word in her native language, Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning.When she named the young narrator of “The House on Mango Street” Esperanza, she wasn’t just giving her a pretty name. “Esperanza” can mean waiting, expectation or hope in English. In the story, the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name, saying, “In Spanish, it means too many letters. It means sadness, it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color.”“I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn’t translate well into U.S. culture,” Ms. Cisneros said, “as well as one that would mean wish, desire and hope.”
