 The programs serve thousands in secondary schools, and millions of students in more than 1,600 two-year colleges. They encompass a broad range of trades, like health science, information technology and business management, and in many cases, are an off-ramp to four-year colleges and universities. The group also noted that career and technical education students tend to have lower dropout rates and are more likely to graduate on time.“High-quality C.T.E. programs are thriving,” the organization said in a statement. “The biggest barrier to their continued success and the opportunity for more students to access their programs are funding cuts, including a proposed 15 percent cut in the president’s own fiscal year 2018 budget to C.T.E. programs.”Mr. Trump’s speeches may have been more like a rhetorical appeal to the base that elected him, particularly blue-collar workers, than a policy proposal.But the president’s comments teetered on being “characteristically ignorant,” said Mike Rose, a research professor at the <uname>UCLA Graduate School of Education</uname>, and the author of “The Mind at Work: Valuing the Intelligence of the American Worker.”“The danger is we tend to view these young people who are drawn to these programs in very deficient ways,” Mr. Rose said. “They value intellectual pursuits. They’ve watched industries die in their communities and know the danger of not being able to adapt to other kinds of work.”Mr. Trump’s emphasis on bolstering the role of education in work force development has been largely embraced by education leaders across the country, many of whom are looking to Congress to reauthorize some parts of the Higher Education Act to meet the job demands of the future. Already, through a House bill, members of Congress have made clear their goals to overhaul the law governing higher education to be more responsive to six million unfilled jobs.
