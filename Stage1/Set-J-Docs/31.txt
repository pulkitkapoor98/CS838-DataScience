 The Tab is often compared to other youth-focused websites such as The Odyssey Online, launched from <uname>Indiana University</uname> in 2014, which also uses volunteer writers to cover a range of topics. <uname>Spoon University</uname>, which was bought in May by Scripps Networks Interactive, compiles articles about food contributed by college students and other young writers.

After she received her United States visa in July 2012, she was worried that she wouldnâ€™t be able to get an Israeli exit permit to leave Gaza.Her worry was understandable. In 2008, the State Department withdrew Fulbright grants awarded to Palestinian students in Gaza after they were denied permission to leave by Israel. According to Gisha, only 295 students traveled from Gaza to academic institutions abroad in 2015. Last year, the Palestinian Civil Affairs Committee received more than 400 applications from students for exit permits for the purpose of higher education, but only 37 applications were approved by Israel. Permit requests must be submitted to Israeli authorities at least three weeks before the travel date, and up to 50 days in advance, along with all supporting documents (like approved visas and acceptance letters). In the first half of 2017, the number of exits by Palestinians dropped by 55 percent, compared with the same period in 2016.
