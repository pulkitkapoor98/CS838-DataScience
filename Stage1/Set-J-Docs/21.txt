 Asked whether there was a conflict in employing the same person to both defend and review the institution, Mr. Breslin said he had no comment.<uname>Michigan State</uname> was dealing with a public relations crisis and a growing number of lawsuits when it hired Mr. Fitzgerald, who as the United States attorney in Chicago had built a reputation as a meticulously prepared, unyielding foe of crooks.
 Declaring that the corruption would “make Lincoln roll over in his grave,” Mr. Fitzgerald oversaw the prosecution of Rod R. Blagojevich, the idiosyncratic former governor of Illinois accused of trying to get something in exchange for an appointment to the United States Senate seat that Barack Obama vacated when he was elected president.Mr. Fitzgerald drew national attention by getting a conviction in a leak case against I. Lewis Libby Jr., the former chief of staff for then Vice President Dick Cheney. And he had worked on high-profile terrorism cases from New York, including the trials of four defendants in connection with the 1998 bombings of United States embassies in Kenya and Tanzania.“As far as investigating something, there’s absolutely nobody better,” Sam Adam Jr., one of Mr. Blagojevich’s defense lawyers, said. “As a criminal defense attorney, I can tell you, he was so good at applying pressure to people.”But Mr. Fitzgerald’s role in the <uname>Michigan State</uname> case is not as prosecutor. Since 2016, <uname>Michigan State</uname>’s trustees have paid him and his law firm, Skadden, Arps, along with other lawyers, to deal with the Nassar case and to respond to litigation against the school. The true scope and purpose of the lawyers’ internal review have become a matter of fierce debate in recent days, but the trustees last February said the lawyers’ role was to “represent the university in all aspects of this matter,” adding, “This representation will include conducting the factual review necessary to address the allegations being made and to assess Nassar’s former work at the university.”A <uname>Michigan State</uname> contract with Mr. Fitzgerald’s firm included an hourly rate of up to 90. The ABC affiliate in Detroit reported this month that Mr. Fitzgerald’s firm has billed the university nearly .1 million.“The public relations team at <uname>Michigan State</uname> gave the impression that he was going to do some sort of dispassionate, independent investigation, and that simply was not true,” said John C. Manly, a lawyer for more than 100 of the women who have sued or made claims against <uname>Michigan State</uname>.Mr. Manly said that no one from <uname>Michigan State</uname> or their legal team had sought to interview his clients about what had happened. Mr. Fitzgerald said that his team took “affirmative steps” not to interview victims of the abuse because of ethics rules restricting contact with plaintiffs in civil cases.Among the women suing are five who reported feeling uncomfortable or violated to coaches, trainers and counselors in the late 1990s and early 2000s.
