 Kent Rinehart, dean of admissions at <uname>Marist College</uname>, said that along with the Common App web outage, there have been delays in sending high school transcripts through Naviance, a system used by high school guidance counselors. The problems did not appear to be related.Naviance said in a statement that it was working on the issue.“The worry is that we haven’t even reached the peak of activity,” Mr. Rinehart said on Tuesday. “That peak will likely be tomorrow.”The Common App is meant to streamline the college admission process by allowing students to fill out one standard application and submit it to many schools, though some of the more than 700 colleges and universities that accept the Common App also require students to submit an additional essay or other material.Animated GIFs were a popular way to convey on social media how it felt to be unable to apply while the web portal was down: the scream, the tear, the faint, the overweight basketball player flopping on his belly as he attempted a shot.In a more conciliatory spirit, a student named Kenna offered a confession and an affirmation: “I believe in you Common App. It’s O.K. to be the scapegoat of students who didn’t start earlier, and I didn’t.”Mr. Rawlins of the <uname>University of Oregon</uname> said that students should try not to worry too much. “There’s so much hype around getting this done, it’s understandable there would be stress,” he said. “If they’re in a different time zone, we’re going to err toward midnight on their side. We don’t care about the seconds, just in case you’re curious.”
