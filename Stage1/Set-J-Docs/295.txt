 Students from Puerto Rico and the United States Virgin Islands who attend the <uname>State University of New York</uname> will pay in-state tuition this school year, the <uname>SUNY</uname> board of trustees said Friday.In making the move, <uname>SUNY</uname> joins several school districts, colleges and universities preparing for an influx of students forced from their homes by recent hurricanes, which have shattered power grids and left residents scrambling for basic staples.And while leaving Puerto Rico has been difficult, the exodus has begun. The office of Gov. Rick Scott of Florida said that since Tuesday, more than 10,000 people from Puerto Rico had arrived in Miami, Orlando and Fort Lauderdale.The <uname>SUNY</uname> boardâ€™s decision, which was adopted in a vote on Friday morning, extends in-state tuition on its 29 campuses not only to students fleeing the devastation, but also to students from Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands who are already enrolled. H. Carl McCall, the chairman of the <uname>SUNY</uname> board, said students who could afford to pay full tuition a few months ago may now find themselves in very different circumstances.
