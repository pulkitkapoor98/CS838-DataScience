 For Dacen Waters, 26, who is in his fourth year of pursuing a doctorate in physics at <uname>Carnegie Mellon University</uname>, the House bill would impose about a ,000 tax increase.In Mr. Waters’s program, the <uname>Mellon College of Science</uname> grants students an annual stipend of 9,400 and a 3,000 tuition waiver. Under the current proposal, their taxable income would rise to 1,000 from 9,000. That would effectively cut students’ net stipend by nearly 0,000 a year.“I already feel like I’m less of a student and more of an employee,” said Mr. Waters, who says that his day mostly consists of research. “And that includes living paycheck to paycheck. If I had to absorb this, I definitely wouldn’t be able to continue pursuing a degree.”He said such an increase would force him out of school, and possibly out of a career.“It’s pretty unheard-of to do anything in physics and not have a doctoral degree,” Mr. Waters said.
