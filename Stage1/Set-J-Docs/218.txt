 Now, he said, he is “thrilled” that the Lions are winning. “I have absolutely no reservation.”“My feelings as an alumnus are very different from when I was a student,” said Stephen Holtje, <uname>Columbia College</uname> class of 1983. When he was in the university’s marching band, he said, “Being a rabid sports fan was not really hip. I remember taking great delight in <uname>Columbia</uname>’s perfection of the forward fumble.”Today, Mr. Holtje is manager of the record label ESP-Disk and has a different slant. “I no longer need to be hip and ironic,” he said. “When they’re losing, it means nothing and I don’t notice. But when they win, it’s like this amazing blessing out of nowhere.”Mr. Holtje dismissed any notions that <uname>Columbia</uname>’s current football prowess might overshadow the university’s emphasis on academics. “It’s sufficiently obvious that we will not be <uname>Ohio State</uname>,” he said, “so we don’t have to worry — even if we have an undefeated season.”But Mr. Passaro, among others, is not satisfied. For him, today’s Lions symbolize a cheerful, rah-rah <uname>Columbia</uname> that he derides as “<uname>Princeton</uname> on the Hudson.” To his mind, the authentic <uname>Columbia</uname> is the scrappy institution of higher learning he attended in the 1970s — when New York was bankrupt, the Baker Field stadium was rotting and the Lions were reassuringly predictable bums.“Whatever this miraculous thing is that you’re telling me about, I don’t understand it and I don’t like it,” Mr. Passaro said. “My <uname>Columbia</uname> was a happily bohemian place and I wish it were still.”
