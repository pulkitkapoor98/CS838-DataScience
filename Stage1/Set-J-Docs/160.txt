 For thousands of students anxiously trying to apply to colleges, it must have felt like disaster: Just before midnight on Monday, with barely 48 hours to go before the early deadline at many colleges, the web portal used by more than a million students a year started balking, and then shut down completely.The Common Application, the nonprofit organization that runs the web portal, posted on Twitter Monday night that, because of “technical difficulties,” it was taking the application system off line for two hours to make repairs.Many students, admissions officers, guidance counselors and teachers reacted to the shutdown with snark and a strong dose of gallows humor. Many of them postponed their bedtimes.Were Russian hackers to blame? That was a popular joke among admissions officers, according to Jim Rawlins, director of admissions at the <uname>University of Oregon</uname>. “Either the Russians, or one of their competitors that’s just jealous of them,” Mr. Rawlins said on Tuesday.
