 This is particularly outrageous given <uname>University of Wisconsin</uname>’s long and illustrious history of student protest, which my professors proudly pointed out during freshman orientation. Students defended socialists in 1910, argued for women’s suffrage in 1919, and, in the 1960s, opposed everything from segregated lunch counters to nuclear testing to the draft. Madison’s current mayor and <uname>University of Wisconsin</uname> alum, Paul Soglin, got his political start by leading years of protests against the Vietnam War. I participated in the February 1999 protest that culminated in the university’s chancellor, David Ward, signing tougher anti-sweatshop guidelines for companies that did business with the school, and the September 1999 walkout to protest tuition hikes.
