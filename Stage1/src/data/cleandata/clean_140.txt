Over the course of the semester, Dr. Harris’s behavior escalated, the complaint said — personal questions about the woman’s family turned into comments on her appearance, which turned into inappropriate physical contact. Once, Dr. Harris put his mouth on her breast, the complaint said, and several times he kissed and groped her. He is also said to have explicitly asked her for sexual intercourse. In 2015, after the woman had written Dr. Harris an email informing him that she was no longer comfortable working with him, Dr. Harris invited her to accompany him on a trip, saying that it would be strictly professional and that they would stay in separate hotel rooms. She had continued working with him out of fear of retaliation, the complaint said. But Dr. Harris booked only one room, and he pressed her for sexual contact, the complaint said. The woman began telling professors about Dr. Harris’s conduct in spring 2015, she said in an interview. Unsatisfied with their responses, she filed a formal complaint with the university in May of this year. That investigation is still open, she said. But she decided to file a civil suit as well, because she had grown disillusioned with <uname>Columbia</uname>’s response.“I felt that my hand was forced,” she said. <uname>Columbia</uname>’s handling of sexual misconduct accusations has come under fire before, most prominently after an undergraduate student carried a mattress around campus for a year in protest after the university cleared a man she said had raped her. In July, <uname>Columbia</uname> settled a lawsuit that the man, Paul Nungesser, had filed over the university’s treatment of him; <uname>Columbia</uname> said it would review its policies.
