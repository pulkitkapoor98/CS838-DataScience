The professors involved in these episodes all declined, or did not respond to, requests for comment. The <uname>University of Sydney</uname> said in a statement that no professors had been forced to apologize for statements relating to China.
 But some faculty members said Australian universities were simply struggling with how to handle a new generation of Chinese students who feel more nationalistic and more empowered. Merriden Varrall, director of the East Asia program at the <uname>Lowy Institute</uname>, a think tank in Sydney, added that many students came up through a Chinese education system that teaches modern history as “the century of humiliation,” in which foreigners have kept China down since the Opium Wars of the 19th century.“To many of them, it is not a question of a fair academic debate about an interesting topic,” Dr. Varrall said. “It is as if someone is criticizing their family.”Some Chinese students argue that they are not harming critical debates, but rather, adding perspective.“The confrontations between Chinese students and academics that have appeared recently are opportunities for people from different cultures to understand how Chinese people think,” said Wang Junling, 38, a Chinese writer who graduated in June from <uname>James Cook University</uname> in Queensland. That sentiment was echoed by Mr. Gao, the <uname>Monash</uname> student, who said everything taught at Australian universities should be “correct and official.”“I would like to say when we’re abroad, we’re representing the image of China,” Mr. Gao wrote in one article on the quiz incident. “It is everybody’s undeniable responsibility to defend our country’s interests.”Many academics say that is the kind of rigidity that limits freedom of discussion and that sets professors on edge.“I don’t want to wake up tomorrow morning and see a link on WeChat” — a Chinese social media platform — “saying that I said something in a lecture a year ago that hurt people’s feelings,” said Dr. Carrico of the <uname>University of Sydney</uname>. “But that’s the kind of the reality we’re in at the moment.”
