That means the new policy does not affect admissions at the university’s two other female-only colleges, <uname>Newnham College</uname> and <uname>Lucy Cavendish College</uname>. Representatives for the colleges did not respond to an email seeking comment on Wednesday. Germaine Greer, a feminist academic and a former lecturer at <uname>Newnham College</uname> who has argued that transgender women are not “real women,” criticized the decision by <uname>Murray Edwards</uname>.
