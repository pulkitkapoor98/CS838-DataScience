Indeed, the leaders of the <uname>MIT</uname>, <uname>Stanford</uname> and <uname>Princeton</uname> endowments — Seth Alexander, Robert F. Wallace and Andrew Golden, — all trained at <uname>Yale</uname>. The strategy of using outside managers to handle these diverse asset groups has been widely imitated. One holdout had long been <uname>Harvard</uname>, where a large chunk of the endowment was managed internally. But under its new chief, N. P. Narvekar, more of the funds will be overseen by outside firms as <uname>Harvard</uname> shrinks its own staff. The diversification approach at many of the largest endowments has generated some skepticism in an era when stock markets have been strong. But over a 20-year period ended June 7, <uname>Yale</uname> pointed out in its release Tuesday, the endowment produced an average annual return of 12. 1 percent — outperforming domestic stocks, which returned 7. 5 percent, and domestic bonds, which returned 5. 2 percent. Endowments are a crucial component of university budgets. During the financial crisis of 2008, when many endowments plummeted in value, some schools had to cut spending significantly. Distributions from the <uname>Yale</uname> endowment to the operating budget have increased at an annualized rate of 9. 2 percent over the past two decades. It is the university’s largest source of revenue, and in the current fiscal year, it is expected to contribute .3 billion, roughly 34 percent of the university’s operating budget.
