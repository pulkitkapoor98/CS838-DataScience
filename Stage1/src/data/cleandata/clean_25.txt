 “These extremists feel emboldened in the current political climate, and they openly boast about efforts to create a physical presence on campuses, where students are engaged in the war of ideas,” Mr. Greenblatt said. Last December, <uname>Texas A&M University</uname> was part of that battlefield. Richard B. Spencer, the white nationalist who led the Charlottesville torch bearers, gave a speech in a <uname>Texas A&M</uname> lecture hall, sparking protests that resulted in two arrests. Mr. Spencer was expected to speak again next week at a “White Lives Matter” event on the College Station campus, but the university’s president, Michael K. Young, canceled the event, citing the advertisement headline “Today Charlottesville, Tomorrow <uname>Texas A&M</uname>.”Mr. Spencer’s venue requests for the fall semester have also been rejected at <uname>Pennsylvania State University</uname>, <uname>Michigan State University</uname>, <uname>Louisiana State University</uname>, the <uname>University of North Carolina</uname> at Chapel Hill and the <uname>University of Florida</uname>. Florida’s president, W. Kent Fuchs, wrote in a statement that “the First Amendment does not require a public institution to risk imminent violence to students and others.”
