HANOVER, N. H. — Three <uname>Dartmouth</uname> professors whose research included studies of sexual desire and attractiveness have been put on paid leave while a criminal investigation of alleged sexual misconduct is carried out, the authorities said Tuesday. Attorney General Gordon J. MacDonald of New Hampshire said his office was part of a joint criminal investigation by five law enforcement agencies into allegations of “serious misconduct” by the professors, all male tenured faculty members in the Department of Psychological and Brain Sciences. The professors’ access to the <uname>Dartmouth</uname> campus has been restricted. Details of the allegations were not released, but Mr. MacDonald’s statement said the criminal investigation arose after an inquiry to college officials by the college newspaper, The <uname>Dartmouth</uname>, which reported last week that the professors had disappeared from their campus posts and fliers had been posted around campus inquiring as to their whereabouts. At that time, the college, which has 4,300 undergraduates and 2,000 graduate students, announced that it was conducting its own official review.
