Mr. Spencer will be appearing at the school’s Phillips Center for the Performing Arts. A security checkpoint will be set up, and 700 tickets will be handed out there on a first-come, first-serve basis, according to altright. com, raising the possibility that many of those attending will be there to heckle him. What are other universities doing?Mr. Spencer’s requests to speak have been rejected by <uname>Pennsylvania State University</uname>, <uname>Michigan State</uname>, <uname>Louisiana State</uname> and the <uname>University of North Carolina</uname> at Chapel Hill. Soon after the Charlottesville violence, <uname>Texas A&M</uname> canceled his planned Sept. 11 appearance there. But the <uname>University of Cincinnati</uname> last week said that it would grant Mr. Spencer a venue, with the date to be determined. A lawsuit was filed on Mr. Spencer’s behalf against <uname>Michigan State</uname>. A similar lawsuit, against <uname>Auburn University</uname>, resulted in a federal judge’s ruling that he be allowed to speak there this past spring. Some universities have rules requiring that speakers be invited by a student or student group. But the <uname>University of Florida</uname> has no such requirement. Although universities are now dealing with protests and violence surrounding speakers on the right, there have been other eras when speakers on the left were the target. There were protests against the <uname>University of Florida</uname> for allowing Abbie Hoffman, the Yippie leader and member of the Chicago Seven, to appear in 1970, Mr. Calvert said, and for letting a lieutenant of Louis Farrakhan, leader of the Nation of Islam, speak in the 1990s.“It kind of shows the viewpoint neutrality of the First Amendment,” Mr. Calvert said. “You’ve got to take them all.”
