The seminar then takes up books in which various economists offer their perspectives on the nature of man and the state. One of the most popular is “Capitalism and Freedom” by Milton Friedman, the onetime <uname>University of Chicago</uname> professor who was a fearless defender of classical liberalism (a. k.a. libertarianism). Even students who disagree with Professor Friedman appreciate the force and clarity of his arguments. Economic inequality, along with the question of how to judge fairness in society, plays a significant role in our discussions. The stage is set with “Equality and Efficiency: The Big Tradeoff,” by Arthur M. Okun, the economist from the Brookings Institution who was an adviser to President Lyndon B. Johnson. According to Mr. Okun, redistributing income is like trying to help the thirsty with a leaky bucket: We can achieve a fairer allocation of resources only by losing some along the way. The perspective of the left is represented by Thomas Piketty’s 2015 book, “The Economics of Inequality,” which is much briefer than his “Capital in the Twenty-First Century,” the surprise best-seller from a few years ago. The perspective of the right comes from “Fair Play: What Your Child Can Teach You About Economics, Values, and the Meaning of Life” by the iconoclastic <uname>University of Rochester</uname> economist Steven E. Landsburg. He suggests that the values we learn on the playground can inform society’s broader conceptions of equity. Next, we question economists’ standard assumption that people are rational decision-makers. Over the past two decades, the growing field of behavioral economics has been incorporating the insights of psychology. In some years, we have read “Nudge: Improving Decisions about Health, Wealth, and Happiness” by the <uname>University of Chicago</uname> economist Richard H. Thaler and the <uname>Harvard</uname> law professor Cass R. Sunstein. This year, we are trying “Scarcity: The New Science of Having Less and How It Defines our Lives,” a collaboration between the <uname>Harvard</uname> economist Sendhil Mullainathan and the <uname>Princeton</uname> psychologist Eldar Shafir.
 The seminar concludes with “The Myth of the Rational Voter: Why Democracies Choose Bad Policies” by Bryan Caplan, an economist at <uname>George Mason University</uname>. The book was written about 10 years ago, but given the current dysfunction in Washington, it seems more relevant than ever. As anyone who has ever joined a book club can attest, good readings are important, but even more vital are the right members. This is true for discussion-based seminars as well. Whenever I offer this course, about 10 times as many students apply as there are slots. The university gives its faculty wide latitude in choosing which students to admit. My main goal is diversity. To begin, I admit an equal number of men and women. The economics profession has been accused of having a toxic environment for women. To the extent that’s true, gender balance helps counteract it.
