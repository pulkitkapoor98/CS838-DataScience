Here’s an example from <uname>Macalester College</uname>, where I am president. Our school is fortunate to have as a student a young man (whose name I can’t mention) who has published a book (whose title I can’t cite). The book has nothing whatsoever to do with athletics, but among his many activities at the college, he participates in an intercollegiate sport (which, of course, shall remain unspecified).
