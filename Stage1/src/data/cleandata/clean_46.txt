<uname>Columbia University</uname>’s investment fund held shares in a company, registered in the Isle of Man, that generated controversy over a pipeline project in Brazil.
 The Appleby records show that investment funds of <uname>Columbia</uname> and <uname>Duke</uname>, both ranked in the top 20 endowments, held shares as recently as 2015 in Ferrous Resources, registered in the Isle of Man. Its primary business is iron mining in Brazil. The company drew criticism there with a planned 480 kilometer pipeline to transport iron slurry from a mine in Minas Gerais to a port.“Major demonstrations took place against this project, which culminated in the creation of a campaign,’” researchers wrote in a 2015 paper published in the journal Society &amp; Nature. A 2010 environmental study of the pipeline revealed that more than 110,000 people might be affected by noise, dust, soil degradation and water quality issues. The project was postponed in 2012 after a downturn in iron prices. The company, Ferrous Resources, declined to comment, except to say that the project had been discontinued. <uname>Columbia</uname>, which owned more than eight million shares in Ferrous Recources, or 1. 1 percent of the company, declined to comment. Various investment funds connected to <uname>Duke</uname> which also declined to comment, held more than two million shares in the company. While some schools have announced shifts away from controversial investments, others have pointed out that divesting from fossil fuels would probably lead to a significant drop in operating funds.
