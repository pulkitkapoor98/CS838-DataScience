It’s not a done deal — yet. The <uname>City University of New York</uname>, bowing to pressure from prominent African-American leaders from Harlem, on Monday postponed the anticipated appointment of the next president of <uname>City College</uname>, its flagship school. The university had been expected to elevate Vincent G. Boudreau, the college’s interim president for the last year, as the permanent president at its board of trustees meeting. But over the weekend, a letter emailed to The New York Times bearing the names of 20 community leaders, including former Gov. David A. Paterson, former Representative Charles B. Rangel and former Assemblyman Keith L. T. Wright, expressed “disappointment” with Dr. Boudreau, saying that their “input, insight and influence” had not been included in the search process. On Monday morning, some of those leaders plus at least one who was not a signatory, Representative Adriano Espaillat, attended a breakfast meeting at Sylvia’s restaurant in Harlem with Dr. Boudreau; James B. Milliken, <uname>CUNY</uname>’s chancellor; and William C. Thompson Jr., chairman of <uname>CUNY</uname>’s Board of Trustees. Afterward, according to those who attended, the university pledged to arrange meetings with Dr. Boudreau over the next two weeks.“Nobody had reached out to the community,” said Hazel N. Dukes, president of the N. A.A. C.P. New York State Conference. “We want to know his intentions, how he’s going to build a team at the college, whether it’s going to be a diverse team.”
