Among first-year doctoral students studying economics, the share was 32 percent in 2017 — barely changed from 33 percent in 2000, according to the report. The imbalance is so great that in six of the “top twenty” economics programs, fewer than one-fifth of the incoming doctoral students were women. This decline in the share of women at relatively early stages of the economics career path is already beginning to reshape the field at more senior levels. For instance, the report, which was published by the American Economic Association’s Committee for the Status of Women in the Economics Profession, shows that about six years after the share of women starting doctoral programs began to shrink, the share of women completing Ph. D.’s also began to decline. And seven years after that, the share of women among tenured associate professors of economics stopped rising. The share of female full professors of economics has continued to increase — it is now 14 percent in those departments with doctoral programs — at least in part because greater numbers of women entered economics in the 1970s, 1980s and 1990s. The end of that influx around the year 2000 can be expected to lead to a plateau in full professor ranks down the road. These figures were compiled by Margaret Levenstein, an economist at the <uname>University of Michigan</uname>. My own analysis of data from the Census Bureau’s American Community Survey substantiates the trends identified by Dr. Levenstein and shows some of them arising even earlier in the educational pipeline. (While I also serve on the Committee for the Status of Women in the Economics Profession, I played no role in her report.)
