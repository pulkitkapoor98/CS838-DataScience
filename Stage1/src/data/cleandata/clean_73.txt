ALONG THE MASSACHUSETTS TURNPIKE — It’s high season for the people with some of the toughest jobs in higher education. No, not the admissions officers and their piles of applications. I’m talking about the people who run what’s come to be known as enrollment management. When they’re not talking to the families writing the tuition checks, they speak in business terms — of overall discount rates and net tuition revenue. Make no mistake, their field is competitive. “It’s a zero-sum game,” said John Dolan, who works in this area at <uname>Simmons College</uname> in Boston. “Every student I gain I took from some other institution.”Their tool for attracting students is the scissors they wield to cut the list price of their school, and the discount isn’t just based on what your family can afford anymore. There is also a shadow financial aid system known as “merit aid,” which is a form of discounting that has little to do with your finances.
 Because <uname>Wellesley College</uname> has a large minority of families willing to pay full price and a healthy endowment, it has been a holdout on merit aid and awards aid based on financial need.
