As the child of a divorced, unemployed mother, Shira Eisenberg learned to get by, she says, “on the kindness of strangers.” But even she was surprised when she arrived at the <uname>University of Chicago</uname> and was told that if she jumped through a few hoops, like going to seminars on how to behave at a job interview, she would be guaranteed a paid internship, financed by the university if no other source of money was available.“Without the stipend, I would not have been able to afford it,” said Ms. Eisenberg, a sophomore majoring in computer science and minoring in neuroscience. Internships have become a necessary credential in a highly competitive job market — about half of interns are offered a job by a company where they have interned, according to a 2017 survey by the National Association of Colleges and Employers. But for those thinking of careers in nonprofits, public service, social services or the arts, paid opportunities are scarce. Employers often can’t afford a stipend, and many students can’t afford to work for free.
