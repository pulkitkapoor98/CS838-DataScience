<uname>Simmons College</uname> does not disclose on its website the credentials of those who receive merit aid as Mount Holyoke does, but is considering adding them.
 “I think there are people who don’t quite demonstrate financial need that truly need the help,” she said. Smith does not, however, provide much explanation about who may qualify for these discounts or how. I pressed the college for some average SAT scores or grade point averages, but it would not hand any over. “We don’t admit statistics, we admit individuals, and individuals are infinitely more complex than the sum of their numerical parts,” said Stacey Schmeidel, a college spokeswoman. Just across the Pioneer Valley, <uname>Mount Holyoke</uname> does indeed provide overall merit aid qualification data for named merit scholarships on its website. After I visited, however, I asked for a breakdown by merit scholarship type and did not receive one. In an interview there, Gail Berson, the vice president for enrollment and dean of admission, described her growing comfort with merit aid. “We’re trying to discount not just for need but for others who are most deserving in other ways,” she said. She also acknowledged the realities of the marketplace, noting the need to “fend off” competition like the selective honors college with the lower sticker price at the flagship state university just up the road, the <uname>University of Massachusetts</uname>. Which brings us back to Dr. Dolan at Simmons, he of the zero-sum game. He told me that his staff uses matrices created by outside consultants at the Human Capital Research Corporation to try to make the right merit aid offer to the right student at the right time. He doesn’t mince words in describing how he changed his approach to financial aid, once it became clear that Simmons, a small liberal arts school in Boston, was going to need to offer a discount to everyone to attract the right number and type of students.
