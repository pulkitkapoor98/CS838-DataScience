The percentage of students who identify as African-American grew modestly during Dr. Faust’s tenure, to 10 percent from 8 percent, according to <uname>Harvard</uname> data. The percentage of Latino students also increased. Brian Greene, a professor of physics and mathematics at <uname>Columbia University</uname> who serves on <uname>Harvard</uname>’s Board of Overseers, applauded Dr. Faust’s efforts to increase diversity. “Her focus on making <uname>Harvard</uname> a far more inclusive, a far more diverse community, all the way from undergraduates to tenured faculty, has been a major achievement,” he said. Informed by her historian’s background, Dr. Faust urged <uname>Harvard</uname> to acknowledge its links to slavery. Under her, the law school eliminated a shield based on the crest of a slaveholding family, the “house master” title was dropped for residential leaders, and a plaque was placed on a building in honor of four slaves who lived and worked there in the 1700s. But her tenure has not been without significant challenges. Shortly after Dr. Faust took office, the university’s endowment lost 27 percent of its value in one year, hit hard by Wall Street’s crash. That forced <uname>Harvard</uname> to make cuts, and after the recession, the endowment performed poorly for several years. Critics charged that under Dr. Faust, leaders were slow to recognize how their investment strategy hobbled <uname>Harvard</uname>’s ability to profit from the recovery. The endowment was 5. 7 billion last year, slightly below its pre-recession level, but still the largest of any American university. More recently, Dr. Faust presided over a record-breaking fund-raising campaign that has raised over  billion.
 “It has been a privilege beyond words to work with all of you to lead <uname>Harvard</uname>, in the words of her alma mater, ‘through change and through storm,’” Dr. Faust said in a message to the <uname>Harvard</uname> community Wednesday. Through a spokesman, she declined to be interviewed. Within weeks, the university’s trustees are expected to form a committee to search for a new president. Dr. Faust, who will step down at the end of next June, had a compensation package of .2 million in the 2014-15 academic year, according to <uname>Harvard</uname>’s most recent publicly available tax returns.
