•Prescription pills are part of the party mix. Xanax, a highly addictive anxiety drug, has become a popular accompaniment to beer and vodka shots. Adderall is crushed for snorting. And Vicodin is ingested as a relaxant, available from students with prescriptions or on an online black market. Dr. Joseph Lee, medical director for youth services at the Hazelden Betty Ford Foundation, says that students act as mixologists, creating dangerous drug and alcohol cocktails for themselves and friends. “They are alarmingly familiar with what they can do to get high, but not the danger,” he said, “and they don’t know where to get help.”Students in recovery confirm this. Many of them say that in high school and college they were purposeful about their drug use, smoking pot to calm down and taking stimulants to speed up. The technique worked well, until overuse and mixed use began to alter the impact. Drugs that were supposed to do one thing did another. Bart Arconti, a junior at the <uname>University of North Carolina</uname> at Chapel Hill, got hooked on prescription painkillers in the basement of his best friend’s townhouse in a Baltimore suburb. He was 17. His friend had bought hydrocodone from a neighbor. They crushed a pill on the washing machine lid and snorted it. It became his favorite high.
