It had been widely assumed that Dr. Faust, 69, the university’s 28th president, would leave her post soon. Although her term will not last as long as those of some of her predecessors, she was nearly 60 when she took office. Recently, she has been involved in a bruising battle over efforts to ban all-male “final clubs” at <uname>Harvard</uname>. While many have applauded sanctions aimed at the clubs, which were criticized last year in a university report for their deeply misogynistic attitudes, others have called those efforts a dubious attack on freedom of association. Richard T. Porteus Jr., graduate president of <uname>Harvard</uname>’s exclusive Fly Club, a final club that counted President Franklin D. Roosevelt as a member, has clashed with Dr. Faust over the issue. Nevertheless, Mr. Porteus, of the class of 1978, said in an email on Wednesday: “Many critics of President Faust’s policies and pronouncements respected her as a person and enjoyed interacting with her. She was indefatigable in advancing <uname>Harvard</uname>’s interests.”Other accomplishments during her tenure include the return of four branches of R. O.T. C., the Reserve Officers’ Training Corps, after Congress lifted the ban on gays’ serving openly in the military; the creation of new joint-degree programs; and the strengthening of the sciences, particularly by significantly expanding engineering programs. The daughter of a thoroughbred horse breeder in Virginia, Dr. Faust, born Catharine Drew Gilpin, graduated from Bryn Mawr in 1968 and received master’s and doctoral degrees from the <uname>University of Pennsylvania</uname>, where she was a professor for 25 years. In 2001, she became dean of the <uname>Radcliffe Institute</uname>, the remaining part of <uname>Radcliffe College</uname>, the women’s college absorbed into <uname>Harvard</uname>. Her book “This Republic of Suffering: Death and the American Civil War” was a National Book Award finalist. It explored the effects of the Civil War’s huge death toll on 19th-century Americans.
 ORLANDO, Fla. — A year ago today, a mass shooting during a Latin-theme dance night at Pulse, a popular gay bar in Orlando, Fla., left 49 people dead, more than 50 injured and the city — particularly its L. G.B. T. and Latino communities — shaken. I woke up to about 60 notifications on my phone that morning. Most were from friends and family asking if I was O. K. My mother was crying, worried I had been at the club. A drag queen from “RuPaul’s Drag Race,” who I love, performed there that night, so it was entirely possible. Three years before, as a freshman at the <uname>University of Central Florida</uname>, I often went to Pulse with my new college friends, all of us L. G.B. T. in one way or another and looking for a sense of community that seemed out of reach in straight daylight. I was the editor in chief of the university’s digital newspaper at the time of the shooting. (I graduated last month.) So the rest of the notifications I woke up to were from my staff. I posted a Facebook status confirming my safety, called my mom to reassure her and rushed to divvy up the day’s coverage with my news team.
