The N. C.A. A. is embroiled in scandal yet again. Last week, federal prosecutors charged several coaches, an agent and a sports apparel executive with, essentially, illegally profiting off branding opportunities for basketball players. That shouldn’t really surprise anyone. This scandal isn’t truly about corrupt coaches and shoe salesmen. It’s about the lengths to which the N. C.A. A. goes to control every dollar and branding opportunity associated with college athletics. An illegal economy has operated behind high-level college athletics for a long time. Its root cause is that universities with powerhouse sports teams like <uname>UCLA</uname>, <uname>Ohio State</uname> and <uname>Texas</uname> receive nearly 0 million a year from brands like Adidas or Nike, while the athletes wearing the Adidas or Nike apparel are expected to compete purely for the love of the game. College basketball players are worth a lot of money, but they aren’t legally allowed to make it. So the schools, coaches, agents and shoe companies make the money instead — all in the name of “amateurism.”
