James B. Milliken, the chancellor of the <uname>City University of New York</uname>, the largest public urban university system in the country, announced Tuesday that he would step down at the end of the academic year. Mr. Milliken’s announcement comes eight months after he disclosed that he had been diagnosed with throat cancer, and that he would be undergoing treatment that would require him to limit his duties. In a letter to the <uname>CUNY</uname> community Tuesday explaining his decision, Mr. Milliken, 60, said that his prognosis was good, but “some additional health challenges have followed” that will require his attention in the months ahead. He added in an interview: “It does change your perspective a little bit. I gave a good deal of thought to what I was going to spend time doing the next few years, and this seemed like a great time for me to make the change.”The search for a successor is expected to begin in January, with the expectation that a new chancellor would be in place for the 2018-2019 academic year. The chancellor oversees <uname>CUNY</uname>’s 11 senior colleges, seven community colleges and various graduate and professional schools. Mr. Milliken, a lawyer by training, said that he has not finalized his next steps, but he remains on the faculty of <uname>CUNY</uname>’s School of Law and plans to stay in New York City.
