 As a result, educators and other experts say, universities and faculty members have become especially vulnerable to pressure from Chinese students. In one case in late August, at the <uname>University of Newcastle</uname> in New South Wales, a group of Chinese students in an international marketing class took issue with their lecturer, Nimay Kalyani, when he referred to Taiwan as an independent country. China considers the self-governing island part of its territory. The students covertly videotaped an argument with him and mobilized on social media to shame him and the university. In the video, made public by the Chinese-language media, one student can be heard saying: “Chinese students are one-third of this classroom. You make us feel uncomfortable.”The university eventually spoke up on Professor Kalyani’s behalf, describing his statement as accurate in the context of the discussion. But in other instances, universities have been more reluctant to defend the academics involved. Khimji Vaghjiani, a computer science lecturer at the <uname>University of Sydney</uname>, was found to have used a map during a class he taught 18 months earlier, showing India in control of disputed areas around its border with China. Chinese students reported the map to Chinese-language news media, describing it as inaccurate. Dr. Vaghjiani later apologized, explaining that the map was outdated.
