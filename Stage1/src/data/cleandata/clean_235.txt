Following a night of heavy drinking at a fraternity at <uname>Texas State University</uname>, a 20-year-old was found dead. Another 20-year-old died at <uname>Florida State University</uname> in nearly identical circumstances. At <uname>Pennsylvania State University</uname>, the victim was 19. Security cameras and text messages documented the fumbling attempts by fraternity members to revive him and then to cover up the link between his unconscious condition and the 18 or so drinks that they forced on him in a roughly 90-minute span. As he moaned and thrashed and blood from a lacerated spleen filled his abdomen, they waited about 12 hours to summon medical help, by which point it was too late. At <uname>Louisiana State University</uname>, the victim was 18, with a blood alcohol content of .496 percent. That’s more than six times the legal limit for driving and about two and a half times the amount of alcohol that can cause someone to black out. All of these incidents occurred this year — the Texas and Florida ones in the last two weeks — and yet 2017 isn’t some nadir. At least six young men died in connection with fraternity hazing rituals in 2014, according to Hank Nuwer’s Hazing Clearinghouse, a website with a ghastly, heartbreaking tally. Two years before that, seven died.
