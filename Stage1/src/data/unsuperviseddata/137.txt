Whatever happens age old questions about fairness in admissions will surely endure. For one thing the nation can t come to terms with a tricky five letter word merit. Michael Young a British sociologist coined the pejorative term meritocracy over a half century ago to describe a future in which standardized intelligence tests would crown a new elite. Yet as Rebecca Zwick explains in her new book Who Gets In the meaning has shifted. The word merit she writes has come to mean academic excellence narrowly defined as grades and test scores. But that s just one way to think of an applicant s worthiness. Dr. Zwick professor emeritus at the University of California at Santa Barbara has long been a researcher at the Educational Testing Service which develops and administers the SAT. She disputes the notion that testing prowess or any other attribute for that matter entitles a student to a spot at his chosen college. There is in fact no absolute definition of merit she writes. That brings us to you the anxious applicant the frazzled parent the confused citizen all wondering what colleges want. It s worth taking a deep breath and noting that only 13 percent of four year colleges accept fewer than half of their applicants. That said colleges where seats are scarce stir up the nation s emotions. Each year the world famous institutions reject thousands and thousands of students who could thrive there.
