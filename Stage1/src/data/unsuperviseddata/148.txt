Although Dr. Harper believes colleges rely too heavily on ACT/SAT scores he says that the major barriers arise well before the application process even begins. Colleges he said must do more in terms of outreach to encourage underrepresented students to apply. Dr. P rez at Trinity has similar concerns. Although he is convinced that the selection process can be successfully revamped he doesn t think that will solve the No. 1 problem he sees in admissions. The problem is money he said. If I had more funding my class would be more diverse. The conversation we re not having in this country is How do we fund colleges and universities However the admissions process might evolve it surely will continue to serve the interests of colleges first and foremost. Even if someone invents a better more equitable way to gauge applicants potential a college s many wants and needs wouldn t change. Deans would still seek to balance their classes by enrolling a diverse mix of majors from many states and countries. Colleges would still need enough oboe players and theater arts majors. What compels institutions to change is deep discontent said Marie Bigham director of college counseling at Isidore Newman School in New Orleans. If they re only making changes on the margins it indicates that they re mostly content with the way things are. That leads to a big question in an age of widening social inequality. How unhappy are the wealthiest colleges really with the status quo Some of the nation s most selective institutions enroll more students from the top 1 percent of the income ladder than from the bottom 60 percent. Is that simply because of lack of preparation in the K 12 system Flaws within the selection process Or is it evidence as Dr. Harper suggests of a systemic lack of will to change those numbers
