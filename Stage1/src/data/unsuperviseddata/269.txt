The commission s members include Jeremy Foley who retired last year as Florida s athletic director Mary Sue Coleman president of the Association of American Universities and Gene Smith Ohio State s athletic director. The group will examine three broad areas according to the N. C.A. A. The N. C.A. A. s fundamental regulatory arrangement which requires colleges and universities to self police and police one another a model that Emmert said had failed in this instance. The rules regarding three interrelated institutions that were crucial to the scandal outlined by federal authorities apparel companies nonscholastic basketball programs and agents. The three main apparel companies Nike Adidas and Under Armour sponsor most of the high profile teams as well as their own leagues for teenage players that exist outside the high school structure. Players who are or wish to be college athletes are barred from signing with apparel companies but agents and other middlemen are widely suspected of connecting players and companies under the table including through A. A.U. teams one complaint alleged that an Adidas official had conspired to pay three players to commit to college programs sponsored by Adidas. As of now college basketball players also cannot sign with agents. The N. C.A. A. s relationship to the N. B.A. and the N. B.A. rule initiated more than a decade ago barring players from entering the league until they are 19 or one year removed from high school. The so called one and done rule leads the best high school prospects to play college basketball for just one season under little pretense that they are interested in other aspects of college.
