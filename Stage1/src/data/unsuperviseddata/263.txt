No sports arena is more dedicated to its home team s hue than this one. Pantone 542 here known as Carolina Blue colors parts of the court the padding behind the baskets the seats the seat cushions the beams and vents in the rafters even the overhead speakers. It is snowier than the regal azure of North Carolina s archrival down Tobacco road yet sterner than powder blue. This balance between dark and light might be said to fit North Carolina s fan base which is one of those in college sports that seems as if it genuinely wants to win the right way even if like many fans it might sooner part with the right way than the winning. Many fans reactions to the scandal Friday were defiant when it came to the N. C.A. A. but chastened when it came to their own standards. I have to say I m not proud of what happened said Stone and there were some things that needed to change and I m glad it was brought to light.
