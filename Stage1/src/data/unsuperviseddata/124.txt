Ms. Cisneros who is Mexican American described an interaction with her thesis adviser at the prestigious Iowa Writers Workshop when she began writing The House on Mango Street. She had written the novella in English but inflected it with Spanish phrasings. The adviser criticized her for overusing the word little unaware how frequently the suffix ito for little or cute is used in Spanish. The incident she said impeded her connection to Spanish. I didn t realize it until after I d left Iowa Ms. Cisneros said. I was writing a letter in Spanish and I thought this is the voice of The House on Mango Street. In her choice of a single word in her native language Ms. Cisneros was able to greatly affect meaning. When she named the young narrator of The House on Mango Street Esperanza she wasn t just giving her a pretty name. Esperanza can mean waiting expectation or hope in English. In the story the girl poetically expresses a blend of feelings about her name saying In Spanish it means too many letters. It means sadness it means waiting. It is like the number nine. A muddy color. I wanted it to be a traditional name that wouldn t translate well into U. S. culture Ms. Cisneros said as well as one that would mean wish desire and hope.
