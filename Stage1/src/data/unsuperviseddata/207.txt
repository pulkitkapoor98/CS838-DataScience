ITT Technical Institute in Florida gave students the impression they d be having careers along the line of C. S.I. Miami. Actually they frequently wound up working as security guards degree in hand and 0 000 in debt. There are so many awful for profit school stories. There was that one in New York that sold students a 5 000 Gold Elite Package and had to change its name to Entrepreneur Initiative after the state determined it had no right to call itself a university. The outcomes for people who take out loans at for profits are abysmal said Ben Miller of the Center for American Progress. He added that almost all the students borrow for courses they could sometimes get for one sixth the price at a community college. And about half the people who borrow default.
