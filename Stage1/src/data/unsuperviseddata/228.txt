And some of the most potent advocates for those men have been a group of women their own mothers. Some of the mothers met with Ms. DeVos in July to tell their stories and Ms. DeVos alluded to them in a speech she gave last month. An advocacy group founded in 2013 by several mothers Families Advocating for Campus Equality or FACE has grown to hundreds of families who have exchanged tens of thousands of messages through their email list said Cynthia Garrett co president of the group. The mothers lobby Congress testify on proposed legislation and policy and track lawsuits filed by men who say they have been wrongly accused. A bill in the California Legislature that they testified against which would have enshrined the Obama era regulations into state law passed both houses but was vetoed this month by Gov. Jerry a Democrat who said it was time to pause on the issue. The group holds twice yearly meetings where parents and sons share personal experiences and listen to advice from psychologists and lawyers. Away from the public eye families have spent tens of thousands of dollars and dipped into retirement savings to hire lawyers and therapists for their sons. Some have pressured colleges to reconsider punishment or expunge disciplinary notations from transcripts so that other colleges and employers cannot see them. Ms. Seefeld said she hired a lawyer and even a public relations firm and used her political connections as a teachers union leader to try to get the University of North Dakota to reverse her son s three year banishment after a woman accused him of nonconsensual sex. I was willing to do everything and anything Ms. Seefeld said. Her son Caleb Warner was ultimately cleared after the college took a second look at the case. The mothers resolve comes from their raw maternal instinct to protect their children. But several who agreed to interviews also said they did not doubt that their sons accusers had felt hurt.
