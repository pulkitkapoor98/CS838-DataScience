At Michigan students ramped up their response to the door tag slur incident by taking a page from Rosa Parks s notebook. They used their own bodies to block transit at a central bus stop on campus. They also subverted stereotypes black students sat in the road with books open on their laps while white allies stood to protect them from traffic. The campus police did not interfere but immediately barricaded the street to ensure everyone s safety. This creative protest broadcast the rejection of racially divisive acts more forcefully than any faculty statement produced that week. And in positioning their bodies in spatial relation to one another the students presented a living picture in which people of diverse skin tones ethnicities and identities could gather together on contested ground to claim their shared belonging. These bodies in space out of place engaging in the unexpected to advance a positive idea sent a message with meaning. Soon after the 2016 presidential election the political scientist Frances Fox Piven wrote in The Nation that to be effective protest movements must generate mass refusals that disrupt the complex systems on which everyday life depends. When protesters insert their bodies into forbidden places or adopt poses unsanctioned for their station they are engaging in blatant acts of refusal. Rosa Parks did exactly this when as Jeanne Theoharis recounts in her biography of Parks she decided to withdraw her participation in a system that was degrading by refusing to change seats on the bus.
