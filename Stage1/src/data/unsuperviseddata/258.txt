Do you have a spine tingling story to share about your school or alma mater Submit it here and we ll publish our favorites in time for Halloween. During my sophomore year I lived in a haunted dorm. I ll admit I have always loved a good ghost story. So you could say I was primed to have a ghost sighting or at least hopeful for one. And at Kenyon College in Ohio where I went to school ghosts are a big part of campus lore. Every October the security guards host a bonfire and recount straight faced tales of disappearing footprints disembodied wails and an elevator that operated on its own. One professor leads a haunted campus tour and Kenyon alumni from different generations share versions of the stories at reunions and gatherings it s part of our shared language and a useful conversation starter. The stories themselves are regularly embellished and some have taken on mythic proportions but the original tales come from a handful of tragic accidents over the last century.
