LONDON Transgender women will be allowed to enroll in one of the three female only colleges at Cambridge University the school has said. The decision made by the college council last week and announced on Monday means that transgender women can apply to Murray Edwards College for a place in the term that begins next October said a spokeswoman Clare Stroud. The college president Barbara Stocking said in a statement that We are a college that is open to all outstanding young women and so it is absolutely right both legally and within our set of values for anyone who identifies as female to be able to apply to study with us. The school said it would consider applications from any student who identifies as female and where they have been identified as male at birth has taken steps to live in the female gender.
