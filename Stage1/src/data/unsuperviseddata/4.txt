MELBOURNE Australia It was a routine quiz in a university business class in Australia but the answer to one of the questions was a surprise Chinese officials are truthful only when careless or drunk. Gao Song a student from China at Monash University in Melbourne was so upset that he condemned it online. His post created a stir back in China where it was quoted in the local news media. The Chinese Consulate in Melbourne contacted him requesting regular updates. Global Times an influential state run newspaper in China asked him to write articles about the incident. Under pressure the university judged the question to be inappropriate and it suspended the professor. As China is becoming more and more powerful we have strong backing even when we re overseas said Mr. Gao 24. When others find faults with China we can stand up to them and tell them we Chinese are great. Professors have been singled out by name and covertly videotaped. Some have been disciplined by their universities. One professor was forced to apologize after the internet erupted with criticism over a map that he had used in a class 18 months earlier. In many cases professors say they feel the pressure more subtly. Kevin Carrico an American lecturer in Chinese studies at Macquarie University in Sydney said he faced icy silence in a recent class when he mentioned the lack of individual rights during the Qin dynasty 2 200 years ago. The students who mostly came from mainland China at first refused to say a word. Then two spoke up to insist that human rights were irrelevant to the discussion. It made me feel like I was teaching an awkward anatomy class or something like that said Dr. Carrico who previously taught at Stanford. But really we were just talking about politics.
