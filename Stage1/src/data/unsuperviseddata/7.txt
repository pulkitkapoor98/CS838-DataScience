Mr. Ellis s death and the suspension of Greek activities at Texas State came on the heels of almost identical events at Florida State University. Andrew Coffey 20 a junior transfer student and Pi Kappa Phi pledge at Florida State was found dead in off campus housing in Tallahassee Fla. on Nov. 3 after a fraternity party the night before and the university suspended fraternity and sorority activities a few days later. A similar case at Louisiana State University resulted in the arrests of 10 current and former students last month. They have been charged in the death of Maxwell Gruver 18 a freshman who died of alcohol poisoning after a hazing ritual at the Phi Delta Theta fraternity. Mr. Gruver s blood alcohol content was .496 percent an extraordinary level Most people begin to black out at .200 and .400 can be fatal. And on Monday the day Mr. Ellis died in Texas a district attorney in Pennsylvania charged 10 more students in the death of Timothy Piazza a Beta Theta Pi pledge at Penn State. Eighteen students had already been charged after Mr. Piazza 19 died in February. Investigators found that he had been given at least 18 alcoholic drinks in less than two hours at a fraternity party and video showed him repeatedly falling down a flight of stairs resulting in a fractured skull and ruptured spleen. According to the National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism more than 1 800 college students ages 18 to 24 die each year as a result of drinking including from alcohol related car crashes.
