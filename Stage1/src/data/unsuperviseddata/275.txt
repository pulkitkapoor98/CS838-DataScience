Yale University s endowment the second largest among the nation s colleges has been distinguished in recent years for its handsome returns and for turning out money managers who follow the investment principles of its chief David F. Swensen. But its latest report card issued Tuesday was disappointing. At a time when many of the largest endowments are reporting gains in the midteens Yale said it generated an 11. 3 percent return for the fiscal year ended June 30 bringing its value to 7. 2 billion. Among the better performers were the Massachusetts Institute of Technology which registered a 14. 3 percent increase Stanford University with a 13. 1 percent return and Princeton with 12. 5 percent growth. Dartmouth a far smaller school with a .96 billion endowment appeared a strong winner with a 14. 6 percent return. A number of the larger schools have yet to release returns.
