Back to the Department of Education. One of DeVos s top advisers Robert Eitel is on a leave of absence from a company that operates for profits and once paid more than 0 million to settle charges of deceiving students about the loans they were getting. Which is again even more than that real estate school where some students claimed they were encouraged by instructors to increase the limits on their credit cards. There are well over 3 000 for profit colleges and universities in the country everything from tiny schools that promise to set you off on a career in cosmetology to conglomerates with campuses all over the world. Some of them have names that might seem intended to be confused with somebody else s. Not necessarily thinking of you Brown College Berkeley College Columbia Southern University or Northwestern College. Experts say some for profits are fine. However there have been a ton of horror shows in which low income men and women are promised a path to life changing jobs but wind up with nothing to show except huge loan bills.
