Once known as Blackwell s Island it was called Welfare Island from 1921 until 1973 when it was renamed Roosevelt Island. Mae West was in a show she wrote called Sex and for that she was sentenced to 10 days in the women s workhouse on the island Judith Berdy president of the Roosevelt Island Historical Society said in an interview. The site where Cornell Tech is was originally the Blackwell s Island Penitentiary she said. I just did a tour for about 30 of their students. Yes hi Your site was a penitentiary The penitentiary was so corrupt Ms. Berdy said that city officials decided the only way to fix it was to shut it down and start all over again which they did by building on Rikers Island. The Cornell Tech site was most immediately preceded by the Goldwater campus of the Coler Goldwater Memorial Hospital which specialized in long term care. The Coler building remains on the north end of Roosevelt Island and the Goldwater patients were moved either there or to a new building in East Harlem. The island s remove now offers Cornell Tech something unusual. It is in the city but not of it. Though the campus is only about one third built two other major phases of construction are to follow by the year 2037 by agreement with the city it has the nascent feel of its own little community as well as a grassy green where students can sprawl and impressive views. Protesters gathered outside the site of Ms. Devos s address at George Mason University in Arlington Va.
