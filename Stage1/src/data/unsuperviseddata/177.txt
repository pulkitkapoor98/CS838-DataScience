Twelve Steps to a Compassionate Life a guide to spreading kindness is an odd choice for a political science syllabus. But Shannon Mariotti sees the need. Her seminar about race and class alienation invites contention course readings swing between Tea Party and far left perspectives. The 13 students represent the stew of political views at Southwestern University a liberal arts campus in mostly red Georgetown Tex. Dr. Mariotti pushes buttons but prudently. She wants reactions she said somewhere between nice and angry. She hopes the book from step one Learn about compassion to 12 Love your enemies will teach students to develop compassion and empathy for opposing even distasteful stances. It is not her only Zen move As students settle at a long conference table Dr. Mariotti taps the timer on her iPhone. Classes start with silent meditation. All you are supposed to be doing right now is to breathe in and breathe out. Every time you think of something she said just let it go. Dr. Mariotti designed this upper level course in response to political divisions at Southwestern divisions that have fractured friendships. The only way that kind of polarization in politics will get better is if we can find a way to talk to each other in a way that is sympathetic but not wishy washy.
