He is the American editor of the website Altright. com.The Southern Poverty Law Center which monitors hate groups has called him a suit and tie version of the white supremacists of old a kind of professional racist in khakis though Mr. Spencer has denied that he is a white supremacist. After the presidential election he saluted an audience of more than 200 at the National Policy Institute s annual conference in Washington with the cry Hail Trump hail our people hail victory In response a number of his supporters gave the Nazi salute. In May Mr. Spencer a University of Virginia graduate led a torch bearing group in Charlottesville to a statue of Robert E. Lee the confederate general that the city wanted to remove. They chanted You will not replace us and Blood and soil. That dispute led to a bigger Unite the Right rally in Charlottesville in August which erupted into street violence leaving one woman dead when a car driven by a man associated with white supremacist groups plowed into a crowd. Mr. Spencer appeared again in Charlottesville on Oct. 7 at a small torch lit rally. He did not return a phone call seeking comment on his visit to the University of Florida. Why will the college let him speak After the university denied Mr. Spencer s original request a local lawyer Gary Edinger threatened to sue on First Amendment grounds. Mr. Edinger a First Amendment lawyer said in an interview Tuesday that he had taken the case pro bono. His views do not match Mr. Spencer s he said adding that he had voted for Bernie Sanders because he wanted a socialist for president. The university responded to the lawsuit threat by saying that the ban was not supposed to be permanent and then negotiated conditions of Mr. Spencer s appearance with Mr. Edinger said Janine Sikes a spokeswoman for the university.
