Oh the irony. The University of Chicago is getting a 25 million gift from Ken Griffin the founder of the hedge fund Citadel. The Chicago School of Economics as it is called leans heavily toward free and efficient markets. Mr. Griffin s name and cash earned in a business that depends on markets being inefficient will now endow the university s economics department. To be fair it s not all Milton Friedman laissez faire and Eugene Fama efficient markets theory at Chicago. Look no further than this year s Nobel Prize for economics awarded to the behavioral economist Richard Thaler. His work on human biases might help explain many investors willingness to pay huge fees to hedge funds like Citadel even when as recently the industry s performance has looked anemic at least compared with the stock market. Yet the irony remains inescapable. Most hedge funds exist to generate so called alpha a return over and above the average in the relevant market. That s their pitch and that s how they justify fees that are typically based on 2 percent of assets and 20 percent of gains. Mr. Fama s famous theory which underpins many economic and financial models argues that s impossible. Regardless Mr. Griffin has made his money some .5 billion according to last month s Forbes 400 list of the wealthiest Americans in the real world and kudos to him for promising to give some more of it away. It s the second largest gift in the university s history behind David Booth s 00 million endowment for the business school.
